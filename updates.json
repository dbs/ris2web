        "abstractNote": "Beginning with the founding of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company in 1670, the fur trade dominated the development of the Canadian west. Although detailed accounts of the fur-trade era have appeared, until recently the rich social history has been ignored. In this book, the fur trade is examined not simply as an economic activity but as a social and cultural complex that was to survive for nearly two centuries. The author traces the development of a mutual dependency between Indian and European traders at the economic level that evolved into a significant cultural exchange as well. Marriages of fur traders to Indian women created bonds that helped advance trade relations. As a result of these \"many tender ties,\" there emerged a unique society derived from both Indian and European culture. -- Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "[This book] is a timely and much-needed exposure of historical and contemporary practices of state-sanctioned violence against Black lives in Canada. This groundbreaking work dispels many prevailing myths that cast Canada as a land of benevolence and racial equality, and uncovers long-standing state practices that have restricted Black freedom. A first of its kind, Policing Black Bodies creates a framework that makes legible how anti-Blackness has influenced the construction of Canada's carceral landscape, including the development and application of numerous criminal law enforcement and border regulation practices. The book traces the historical and contemporary mobilization of anti-Blackness spanning from slavery, 19th and 20th century segregation practices, and the application of early drug and prostitution laws through to the modern era. Maynard makes visible the ongoing legacy of a demonized and devalued Blackness that is manifest today as racial profiling by police, immigration agents and social services, the over-representation of Black communities in jails and prisons, anti-Black immigration detention and deportation practices, the over-representation of Black youth in state care, the school-to-prison pipeline and gross economic inequality. Following the dictums of the Black Lives Matter movement, Policing Black Bodies adopts an intersectional lens that explores the realities of those whose lives and experiences have historically been marginalized, stigmatized, and made invisible. In addressing how state practices have impacted Black lives, the book brings from margin to centre an analysis of gender, class, sexuality, (dis)ability, citizenship and criminalization. Beyond exploring systemic racial injustice, Policing Black Bodies pushes the limits of the Black radical imagination: it delves into liberatory Black futures and urges the necessity of transformative alternatives. --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "This book examines life in Canada for the estimated 5,000 blacks, both African Americans and West Indians, who immigrated to Canada after the end of Reconstruction in the United States. Through the experiences of black railway workers and their union, the Order of Sleeping Car Porters, the author connects social, political, labor, immigration, and black diaspora history during the Jim Crow era. By World War I, sleeping car portering had become the exclusive province of black men. White railwaymen protested the presence of the black workers and insisted on a segregated workforce. Using the first-hand accounts of former sleeping car porters, the author shows that porters often found themselves leading racial uplift organizations, galvanizing their communities, and becoming the bedrock of civil rights activism. Examining the spread of segregation laws and practices in Canada, whose citizens often imagined themselves as devoid of racism, she historicizes Canadian racial attitudes and explores how black migrants brought their own sensibilities about race to Canada, participating in and changing political discourse there.",

        "abstractNote": "During the night of April 10, 1734, Montr\u00e9al burned. Marie-Joseph Ang\u00e9lique, a twenty-nine-year-old slave, was arrested, tried, and found guilty of starting the blaze that consumed forty-six buildings. Suspecting that she had not acted alone and angered that she had maintained her innocence, Ang\u00e9lique's condemners tortured her after the trial. She confessed but named no accomplices. Before Ang\u00e9lique was hanged, she was paraded through the city. Afterward, her corpse was burned. Ang\u00e9lique, who had been born in Portugal, faded into the shadows of Canadian history, vaguely remembered as the alleged arsonist behind an early catastrophic fire. The result of fifteen years of research, [this book] vividly tells the story of this strong-willed woman. Afua Cooper draws on extensive trial records that offer, in Ang\u00e9lique's own words, a detailed portrait of her life and a sense of what slavery was like in Canada at the time. Predating other first-person accounts by more than forty years, these records constitute what is arguably the oldest slave narrative in the New World. Cooper sheds new light on the largely misunderstood or ignored history of slavery in Canada. She refutes the myth that Canada was a haven at the end of the Underground Railroad. Cooper also provides a context for Canada in the larger picture of transatlantic slavery while re-creating the tragic life of one woman who refused to accept bondage.\n--Publisher's description",

In fact, in the wake of the American Revolution, many Loyalist families brought slaves with them when they settled in the Maritime colonies of British North America. Once there, slaves used their traditions of survival, resistance, and kinship networks to negotiate their new reality. Harvey Amani Whitfield\u2019s book, the first on slavery in the Maritimes, is a startling corrective to the enduring and triumphant narrative of Canada as a land of freedom at the end of the Underground Railroad. --Publisher's description",

This groundbreaking study subverts this narrative of progress and modernity by examining Canadian nation building from the perspective of a northern community and its residents. Drawing on decades of research and fieldwork, Patricia McCormack argues that Fort Chipewyan--established in 1788 and situated in present-day Alberta--was never an isolated Aboriginal community but a plural society that stood at the crossroads of global, national, and indigenous cultures and economies. The steps that led Aboriginal people to sign Treaty No. 8 and accept scrip in 1899 and their struggle to maintain autonomy in the decades that followed reveal that Aboriginal peoples and others can - and have - become modern without relinquishing cherished beliefs and practices. --Publisher's description.",

But during the twenty years it governed, it wrought a much less scrutinized legacy in the northern regions of the province.\" \"Until the 1940s, churches, fur traders, and other influential newcomers held firm control over Saskatchewan's northern region. Following its rise to power in 1944 the CCF made aggressive efforts to unseat these traditional powers and install a new socialist economy and society in largely Aboriginal communities. The next two decades brought major changes to the region as well-meaning government planners grossly misjudged the challenges that confronted the north and failed to implement programs that would meet its needs. Northerners lacked the voice and political clout to determine policies for their half of the province and the CCF effectively created a colonial apparatus, imposing its own ideas and plans in those communities without consulting residents. While it did ensure that parish priests, bootleggers, and fur sharks no longer dominated the north, it failed to establish a workable alternative.\" \"In written history that documents the colonial relationship between the CCT and northern Saskatchewan, David Quiring draws on extensive archival research and oral history to offer a fresh look at the CCF era. This examination will find an audience among historians of the north. Aboriginal scholars and general readers interested in Canadian history.\"--Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": ", \nA 1964 strike by women workers in Dunnville, Ontario provides an\nexceptional perspective on the complex ways in which class, gender,\nand ethnicity unite in the construction of identity. The women strikers\ndrew on left-wing traditions of feisty femininity to claim an identity as\nreal workers and authentic unionists while also embracing multi-ethnic\nidentities that distinguished them from the Anglo-Celtic middle\nclass. Their claims to authenticity challenged pervasive assumptions,\nincluding those of their union brothers, who defined labor militancy as\nimplicitly male and distorted memories of the strike. Yet the limits on\nthe women's own constructions of these identities are evident in their\ninability to perceive the Native women who scabbed during the strike\nas workers. By contrasting the ways in which identity was claimed,\nassigned, and contested by different groups of workers, this story\nproblematizes categories of identity that are often used uncritically\nin labor history.",

Little research has been conducted on the history of the Indians and almost all of what has been done has been confined to the early contacts between the indigenous people and the Europeans, leaving open a wide field of study. ...The Southern Interior Plateau is an area which provides significant potential for study. It had numerous economic opportunities for white settlers in farming, mining, logging and other industries, but because of its relatively small European population it was necessary for many settlers to rely on its Interior Salish Indian population for wage labour. The major road and rail projects in this area also required labour, and many Indians were able to fit into the region's economy as independent farmers and ranchers. --From introductory section",

        "abstractNote": "Chinese migrant workers in North America have typically been regarded in two ways by\nhistorians: either as competitive threats to white workers, or as workers isolated within ethnic niches. Few scholars have examined cases where Chinese workers complemented or supported the labour of others. This thesis looks at Chinese labour in British Columbia\u2019s salmon canning industry between 1871 and 1941, arguing that Chinese workers were foundational to white fishing jobs in the province. Drawing on company records, Government reports, newspapers, and oral interviews, I examine Chinese manual labour, labour politics, and wages as three areas where Chinese workers upheld the labour of fishers in a nominally \u201cwhite\u201d industry. As such, this thesis offers a different outlook on the structural entanglement of race and labour in British Columbia in the seventy years after the province joined the Canadian Confederation.",

        "abstractNote": "The industrialization of the fisheries of British Columbia began in the second half of the nineteenth century, with the canning of salmon for export to Great Britain. Since fish was an essential staple in the diet of the native peoples living in the pacific northwest, its capture and processing was a vital part of their economic activity. Salmon canners sought a factory labour force at the cheapest possible wage. To the extent that native peoples continued to meet subsistence needs, at least partially, through the native economy, when employed for wages they did not have to be paid the full costs of the production and reproduction of their labour power. Of all the groups employed, native women and their children received the lowest wages and least secure conditions of employment. The paper explores the use of race and gender by salmon canners as a means of creating a labour force and paying it the lowest wages possible, according to the ability of each group to partially realize subsistence needs through pre-capitalist relations of production. Special attention is given to the place of native women in this process.",

        "abstractNote": "Recent studies of labour have clearly established that the capitalist state is very involved in the recruitment, relocation and retention of migrant labour forces. Most of the literature tends to analyze migrant labour within the broader social, political and economic context of expanding capitalism. Consequently, studies tend to focus on how the use of migrant\nlabour is profitable to capitalism because it is cheap and easy to exploit. Such studies, however, neglect the ways in which the state actually intervenes in the labour market in order to facilitate the flow of migrant workers to places of employment. Therefore, this thesis explores the relationship between the migration of labour, the state and the reserve army of labour through an analysis of the Native migrant work force in the sugar beet industry in southern Alberta.",

        "abstractNote": "Research has begun to increasingly document Native peoples' participation in wage employment in Canada. Despite an acknowledgement of native participation in wage labour, little is known of the role of the state in mobilizing Native workers for Canadian industry. Using the case of Native migration to the southern Alberta sugar-beet industry in the 1950s and 1960s, this paper analyzes the role of the state in the mobilization of the native workers for employment. We show that the various levels of the state, acting through federal/provincial manpower committees and the Indian Affairs Branch of the federal government, used a variety of paternalistic and coercive measures to help farmers in southern Alberta recruit and retain Native workers. One of the main measures used by the federal and provincial governments to coerce Native people into migration was to cut off social assistance benefits to those Native people deemed to be employable.",

        "abstractNote": "In 1927, Gabriel Sylliboy, the Grand Chief of the Mi'kmaw of Atlantic Canada, was charged with trapping muskrats out of season. At appeal in July 1928, Sylliboy and five other men recalled conversations with parents, grandparents, and community members to explain how they understood a treaty their people had signed with the British in 1752. Using this testimony as a starting point, William Wicken traces Mi'kmaw memories of the treaty, arguing that as colonization altered Mi'kmaw society, community interpretations of the treaty changed as well. The Sylliboy case was part of a broader debate within Canada about Aboriginal peoples' legal status within Confederation. In using the 1752 treaty to try and establish a legal identity separate from that of other Nova Scotians, Mi'kmaw leaders contested federal and provincial attempts to force their assimilation into Anglo-Canadian society. Integrating matters of governance and legality with an exploration of historical memory, The Colonization of Mi'kmaw Memory and History offers a nuanced understanding of how and why individuals and communities recall the past.\"--Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "Working Class Experience is a sweeping and sympathetic study of the development of the Canadian working class since 1800. Beginning with a substantial and provocative introduction that discusses the historiography of the Canadian working class, the book goes on to establish a general framework for analysis of what ultimately is a social history of Canada. Dividing the years into seven periods in the evolution of class struggle, it beings each chapter with an assessment of that period's prevailing economic and social context, followed by an examination of the many factors affecting the working class during that period. Written in a colourful and sometimes irreverent style, Working Class Experience focuses on the processes by which working people moved, and were moved, off the land and into the factories and other workplaces during the Industrial and post-Industrial Revolutions in Canada. Drawing on much recent work on contemporary capitalism, Working Class Experience offers a significant explanation of the malaise in current labour and management relations and speculates on its significance for progressive change in Canadian Life.  --Publisher's description",

[This book] delves into the long history of deindustrialization in the paper-making town of Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, located on Canada's resource periphery. Much like hundreds of other towns and cities across North America and Europe, Sturgeon Falls has lost their primary source of industry, resulting in the displacement of workers and their families. One Job Town takes us into the making of a culture of industrialism and the significance of industrial work for mill-working families. One Job Town approaches deindustrialization as a long term, economic, political, and cultural process, which did not begin and simply end with the closure of the local mill in 2002. High examines the work-life histories of fifty paper mill workers and managers, as well as city officials, to gain an in-depth understanding of the impact of the formation and dissolution of a culture of industrialism. Oral history and memory are at the heart of One Job Town, challenging us to rethink the relationship between the past and the present in what was formerly known as the industrialized world. --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "Going postal. We think of the rogue employee who snaps. But in [this book] Jeremy Milloy demonstrates that workplace violence never occurs in isolation. Using violence as a lens, he provides fresh and original insights into the everyday workings of capitalism, class conflict, race, and gender in the United States and Canada of the late twentieth century, bringing historical perspective to contemporary debates about North American violence. [The book] is the first full-length historical exploration of the origins and effects of individual violence in the automotive industry. Milloy\u2019s gripping analysis spans 1960 to 1980, when North American auto plants were routinely the sites of fights, assaults, and even murders. He argues that the high levels of violence were primarily the result of workplace conditions \u2013 including on-the-job exploitation, racial tension, bureaucratization, and hypermasculinity \u2013 that made fear and loathing a shop-floor reality long before mass shootings attracted media attention in the 1980s. Workplace violence is typically the domain of management studies and psychology, but while we pass legislation and adopt best practices, the problem continues. Milloy\u2019s explosive book reveals that workplace violence has been a constant aspect of class conflict \u2013 and that our understanding needs to go deeper. Blood, Sweat, and Fear will interest everyone concerned with the causes of workplace violence, and in particular scholars and students of labour history, sociology, sociological criminology, masculinity studies, and studies of race and of violence. --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "After the First World War, many Canadians were concerned with the possibility of national regeneration. Progressive-minded politicians, academics, church leaders, and social reformers turned increasingly to the state for solutions. Yet, as significant as the state was in articulating and instituting a new morality, outside actors such as employers were active in pursuing reform agendas as well, taking aim at the welfare of the family, citizen, and nation. Citizen Docker considers this trend, focusing on the Vancouver waterfront as a case in point.After the war, waterfront employers embarked on an ambitious program - welfare capitalism - to ease industrial relations, increase the efficiency of the port, and, ultimately, recondition longshoremen themselves. Andrew Parnaby considers these reforms as a microcosm of the process of accommodation between labour and capital that affected Canadian society as a whole in the 1920s and 1930s. By creating a new sense of entitlement among waterfront workers, one that could not be satisfied by employers during the Great Depression, welfare capitalism played an important role in the cultural transformation that took place after the Second World War.Encompassing labour and gender history, aboriginal studies, and the study of state formation, Citizen Docker examines the deep shift in the aspirations of working people, and the implications that shift had on Canadian society in the interwar years and beyond. --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "The increased participation of women in the labour force was one of the most significant changes to Canadian social life during the quarter century after the close of the Second World War. Transforming Labour offers one of the first critical assessments of women's paid labour in this era, a period when more and more women, particularly those with families, were going 'out to work'.\n\nUsing case studies from across Canada, Joan Sangster explores a range of themes, including women's experiences within unions, Aboriginal women's changing patterns of work, and the challenges faced by immigrant women. By charting women's own efforts to ameliorate their work lives as well as factors that re-shaped the labour force, Sangster challenges the commonplace perception of this era as one of conformity, domesticity for women, and feminist inactivity. Working women's collective grievances fuelled their desire for change, culminating in challenges to the status quo in the 1960s, when they voiced their discontent, calling for a new world of work and better opportunities for themselves and their daughters. --Publisher's  description",

        "abstractNote": "Joan Sangster's \"Beyond Dichotomies\" (left history, 3.1, Spring/Summer 1995) is a polemic on the relationship between women's history and gender history. As such, it tends to bring out issues and highlight debates but, at the same time, it sometimes inevitably simplifies and potentially misrepresents in order to address important points. As friends and colleagues, we would like to take issue with some of the assertions and suggestions made in Sangster's piece. We think it is important to debate these issues and\nwe hope to make a contribution. Such issues are central in feminist historical debates internationally and, while individuals who write Canadian women's history and gender history have clearly borrowed from the intemational literature, there has been no sustained Canadian \"debate,\" at least not in print. --Introduction",

Reading Joan Sangster's \"Beyond Dichotomies\"\nhad a bit ofthe same effect. Canadian women's history,\nand its relationship to the emerging field of gender history, as we\nhave studied it, taught it, and written it is - from Sangster's\npresentation - barely recognizable. We suppose we are among the\nmembers of the \"younger, more hip generation\" (counterposed,\npresumably, to the sober socialist feminist), whose \"consumer\nchoice\" Sangster decries.

        "abstractNote": "\"What ever happened to the great Canadian labour-history debates of the early\n1980s?' a well-informed Argentinian labour historian asked me recently. The gist of\nmy rambling, uncertain response was \"Things have become a lot more complex.\"\nBryan Palmer must have had similar thoughts when he sat down to revise and update\nhis nearly ten-year-old history of the Canadian working-class.' The publication of his\nself-styled \"rethinking\" of the field2 gives us all an opportunity to reflect on how the\nwriting of working-class history has evolved and changed since those heady days and\nwhat a synthesis of the huge volume of new work ought to look like. It seems\nappropriate to place Palmer at the centre of such a historiographical review since the\n1983 version of his Working-Class Experience was widely seen as the first synthesis\nof the new working-class history and, indeed, in his long series of books and articles,\nand through his penchant for confrontation and debate, Palmer has played a major\nrole in defining what the rest of the historical profession (and many others) thought\nCanadian labour historians were up to. With this new book, he has returned to centre\nstage. --Introduction",

Both lay and professional historians have been in the\nforefront of efforts to recuperate, interpret, and preserve the oral histories of\nworking-class individuals and communities across the globe. They created written\nhistories, archival collections, museum exhibits, and community projects that\ngave workers, their families, and their communities -- those who were less likely\nto leave archival and written sources for posterity -- a new voice, and a new place\nin history. Working-class oral history has also encompassed far more than\nrecovery and preservation. Labour historians have enriched the field of oral\nhistory by addressing questions about method, theory, and approach, by offering\ncritical reflections on our assumptions and expectations about oral history\npractice. Oral history has similarly enriched the field of working-class history,\nposing new questions, challenging existing interpretations, and encouraging the\ndiversification of the themes and subjects we study. In recognition of this\ndynamic relationship, and the ongoing, mutually beneficial conversation between\noral and working-class history, Oral History Forum commissioned this special\nissue. --Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "Across North America, Indigenous acts of resistance have in recent years opposed the removal of federal protections for forests and waterways in Indigenous lands, halted the expansion of tar sands extraction and the pipeline construction at Standing Rock, and demanded justice for murdered and missing Indigenous women. In As We Have Always Done, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson locates Indigenous political resurgence as a practice rooted in uniquely Indigenous theorizing, writing, organizing, and thinking. Indigenous resistance is a radical rejection of contemporary colonialism focused around refusing the dispossession of Indigenous bodies and land. Simpson makes clear that the resistance's goal can no longer be cultural resurgence as a mechanism for inclusion in a multicultural mosaic. Instead, she calls for unapologetic, place-based Indigenous alternatives to the destructive logics of the settler colonial state, including heteropatriarchy, white supremacy, and capitalist exploitation. --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "Originally published in 1975, this important book is now back in print in a revised and updated edition. Since its first publication it has become a classic of revisionist history. Bringing a Native viewpoint to the settlement of the West, Howard Adam's book shook its readers. What Native people had to say for themselves was quite different from the convenient picture of history that even the most sympathetic books by white authors had presented. Until Adams's book, the cultural, historical, and psychological aspects of colonialism for Native people had not been explored in depth. In Prison of Grass Adams objects to the popular historical notion that Natives were warring savages, without government, seeking to be civilized. He contrasts the official history found in the federal government's documents with the unpublished history of the Indian and M\u00e9tis people. In this new edition Howard Adams brings the latest statistics to bear on his arguments and provides a new Preface. --Publisher's description",

The results obtained through our ergonomic approach showed that, in order to organize learning situations, the instructors, who were experienced employees, had to consider physical, material, and organizational conditions and choose between \"what they would have liked to do\" and \"what they could really do.\" The results also showed that the work group can contribute to the training activity. The observations made in our study can serve as food for thought for anyone interested in workplace training conditions.",

        "abstractNote": "Over the past forty years, recognition has become the dominant mode of negotiation and decolonization between the nation-state and Indigenous nations in North America. The term?recognition? shapes debates over Indigenous cultural distinctiveness, Indigenous rights to land and self-government, and Indigenous peoples' right to benefit from the development of their lands and resources. In a work of critically engaged political theory, Glen Sean Coulthard challenges recognition as a method of organizing difference and identity in liberal politics, questioning the assumption that contemporary difference and past histories of destructive colonialism between the state and Indigenous peoples can be reconciled through a process of acknowledgment. Beyond this, Coulthard examines an alternative politics--one that seeks to revalue, reconstruct, and redeploy Indigenous cultural practices based on self-recognition rather than on seeking appreciation from the very agents of colonialism. Coulthard demonstrates how a place-based modification of Karl Marx's theory of primitive accumulation throws light on Indigenous-state relations in settler-colonial contexts and how Frantz Fanon's critique of colonial recognition shows that this relationship reproduces itself over time. This framework strengthens his exploration of the ways that the politics of recognition has come to serve the interests of settler-colonial power. In addressing the core tenets of Indigenous resistance movements, like Red Power and Idle No More, Coulthard offers fresh insights into the politics of active decolonization. --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "Despite the great economic advantage of capitalism - that it is an efficient system of production and distribution - capitalist societies struggle with its by-products of poverty, exclusion, corruption, and environmental destruction. The essays in &quot;Ethics and Capitalism&quot; address the question of ensuring ethical and just societies within a capitalist system without sacrificing productivity. The introductory essay is a guide to the issues in the emerging field of ethics and capitalism, and refers to recent contributions from several disciplines. The collection as a whole evaluates the morality of capitalism by looking at its foundation in property theory, its relationship to democracy, the problems of corruption and globalization, as well as the impact of capitalism on non-European cultures and the environment. Contributors consider various ideological and cultural biases that affect our understanding of capitalism. It is the aim of the collection to defend the practical merits of capitalism while raising concerns about its ethical problems. In conclusion, the volume considers the possibility of a mitigated form of capitalism that would ensure economic efficiency and productivity while avoiding ethical pitfalls. --Publisher's description",

When asking her colleagues why they did not want a union to represent them, a frequent reply was that it was \u201cnot our way.\u201d In other words, organizing to protect workers\u2019 rights is \u201cun-indigenous.\u201d That these views have taken root among employees is indicative of the seductive sway that fixed notions of tradition hold on indigenous people. Many of us fear being accused of what the Plains Cree refer to as moniyakaso; that is, \u201cacting or behaving as a white person.\u201d This article explores these themes in the context of the highly publicized establishment and eventual elimination of a labour union at the Northern Lights Casino in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. --Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "This article considers the significance of indigenous economic systems in contemporary society. It argues that indigenous economic systems have to be taken into account much more systematically than thus far in considerations of indigenous governance. The article contends that indigenous economic systems need to play a more central role in\nenvisioning and shaping meaningful, comprehensive, and sustainable systems of contemporary indigenous self-governance. If indigenous economies are not taken into account, there is a serious danger of losing the very identities that constitute indigenous peoples. ...The article consists of three sections. The first section discusses definitions and contemporary significance of subsistence and indigenous economies. It questions the prevailing narrow, economistic analyses and interpretations of subsistence. Although economic development projects such as resource extraction may improve fiscal independence and strengthen the economic base of indigenous communities, they also present serious threats to indigenous economies.The second section examines the relationship between subsistence and wage labor, particularly from the perspective of women. It also considers the \u201cwar on subsistence\u201d waged by the development and modernization theories, which continue to contribute to views of subsistence as \u201cprimitive\u201d and \u201cpre-modern.\u201d The third section takes a closer look at the often glossed over roles of indigenous women in subsistence activities. It questions the\nconventional binary economic roles of man-the-hunter versus woman-the-gatherer and argues for a broader lens when assessing economic roles and divisions of labor along gendered lines. The article concludes with an examination of indigenous economic systems and the concept of the social economy as a foundation for contemporary indigenous governance. --From Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "In Northern Canada, Indigenous mixed economies persist alongside and in resistance to capital accumulation. The day-to-day sites and processes of colonial struggle, and, in particular, their gendered nature, are too often ignored. This piece takes an anti-colonial materialist approach to the multiple labours of Indigenous women in Canada, arguing that their social-reproductive labour is a primary site of struggle: a site of violent capitalist accumulation and persistent decolonising resistance. In making this argument, this piece draws on social-reproduction feminism, and anti-racist, Indigenous and anti-colonial feminism, asking what it means to take an anti-colonial approach to social-reproduction feminism. It presents an expanded conception of production that encompasses not just the dialectic of capitalist production and reproduction, but also non-capitalist, subsistence production. An anti-colonial approach to social-reproduction feminism challenges one to think through questions of non-capitalist labour and the way different forms of labour persist relationally, reproducing and resisting capitalist modes of production.",

The women strikers\ndrew on left-wing traditions of feisty femininity to claim an identity as\nreal workers and authentic unionists while also embracing multi-ethnic\nidentities that distinguished them from the Anglo-Celtic middle\nclass. Their claims to authenticity challenged pervasive assumptions,\nincluding those of their union brothers, who defined labor militancy as\nimplicitly male and distorted memories of the strike. Yet the limits on\nthe women's own constructions of these identities are evident in their\ninability to perceive the Native women who scabbed during the strike\nas workers. By contrasting the ways in which identity was claimed,\nassigned, and contested by different groups of workers, this story\nproblematizes categories of identity that are often used uncritically\nin labor history.",

The study of working classes as historical formations requires the replacement of underdeveloped concepts with theory adequate to the task. This theory should incorporate the knowledge that class never exists outside of other social relations such as gender and race, but is always mediated by those relations, and vice versa. Marx, Gramsci, Thompson and autonomist Marxism, enriched with the appreciation of the multidimensional nature of social being produced by feminism and other perspectives arising from struggles against oppression, provide important resources for the development of such a theory.",

        "abstractNote": "Canada is in a liminal space, with renewed struggles for and commitments to indigenous land and food sovereignty on one hand, and growing capital interest in land governance and agriculture on the other. While neoliberal capital increasingly accumulates land-based control, settler-farming communities still manage much of Canada\u2019s arable land. This research draws on studies of settler colonialism, racial hierarchy and othering to connect the ideological with the material forces of settler colonialism and show how material dominance is maintained through colonial logics and racially ordered narratives. Through in-depth interviews, I investigate how white settler farmers perceive and construct two distinctly \u2018othered\u2019 groups: Indigenous peoples and migrant farmers and farm workers. Further, I show the disparate role of land and labour in constructing each group, and specifically, the cultural and material benefits of these constructions for land-based settler populations. At the same time, settler colonial structures and logics remain reciprocally coupled to political conditions. For instance, contemporary neoliberalism in Canadian agriculture modifies settler colonial structures to be sure. I argue, however, that political economic analyses of land and food production in Canada (such as corporate concentration, land grabbing and farm consolidation) ought to better integrate the systemic forces of settler colonialism that have conditioned land access in the first place. Of course, determining who is able to access land\u2014and thus, who is able to grow food\u2014continues to be a territorial struggle. Thus, in order to shift these conditions we ought to examine how those with access and control have acquired and maintained it.",

        "abstractNote": "The first major volume to place U.S.-centered labor history in a transnational focus, Workers Across the Americas collects the newest scholarship of Canadianist, Caribbeanist, and Latin American specialists as well as U.S. historians. These essays highlight both the supra- and sub-national aspect of selected topics without neglecting nation-states themselves as historical forces. Indeed, the transnational focus opens new avenues for understanding changes in the concepts, policies, and practice of states, their interactions with each other and their populations, and the ways in which the popular classes resist, react, and advance their interests. What does this transnational turn encompass? And what are its likely perils as well as promise as a framework for research and analysis? To address these questions John French, Julie Greene, Neville Kirk, Aviva Chomsky, Dirk Hoerder, and Vic Satzewich lead off the volume with critical commentaries on the project of transnational labor history. Their responses offer a tour of explanations, tensions, and cautions in the evolution of a new arena of research and writing. Thereafter, Workers Across the Americas groups fifteen research essays around themes of labor and empire, indigenous peoples and labor systems, international feminism and reproductive labor, labor recruitment and immigration control, transnational labor politics, and labor internationalism. Topics range from military labor in the British Empire to coffee workers on the Guatemalan/Mexican border to the role of the International Labor Organization in attempting to set common labor standards. Leading scholars introduce each section and recommend further reading. -- Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "This article historicizes the making of a fur coat in post-1940 Canada, exploring the social relationships and forms of labour that made the fur coat possible: skinning, sewing, and selling. Focusing especially on women's labour, the author examines the significance of Aboriginal women's work, often unwaged, and seldom recognized in many fur-trade sources, as well as the way in which racial constructions of Aboriginal women intersected with the appropriation of their labour. The wage labour of women in a manufacturing sector dominated by eastern European Jewish immigrants, and by a masculine hierarchy of skill, as well as working women's protests and unionization, are also examined, as is retail selling labour in large and small stores. An exploration of these forms of labour, with a focus on gender, provides insights into discussions about the body and working-class history. While many feminist works have emphasized the cultural and discursive in their explorations of fur, the author argues for a theoretical perspective that fuses a feminist critique of race and gender hierarchies with a materialist understanding of labour, class, and alienation. While embracing a feminist scepticism about the existence of a \u201cnatural\u201d body, she argues for the need to avoid the dematerialized body of much postmodern theory in explorations of the body and working-class history.",

        "abstractNote": "Interpretations of Aboriginal women's work have shifted over time, but they have been absolutely central to First Nations women's experiences of colonialism. Yet, in both women's history and Aboriginal history, there has been a \"mystification\" of Indigenous women's labor, because it was often defined as nonproductive or marginal within capitalist economies; wage work was particularly neglected (Littlefield and Knack 1999: 4). Yet, by studying women's labor in its multiple forms (paid, unpaid, voluntary, ceremonial, commodity production), and in multiple contexts (bush, urban, reserve or reservation), we can gain immense insight into how colonialism was structured, experienced, negotiated, and resisted by women at the level of daily life. By perusing past academic writing on Aboriginal women and work, this paper explores some of the intellectual, political, and social influences that have shaped understandings of Aboriginal women's labor in Canada and the United States, asking what insights we have gained, what questions we need to answer, and what contradictions we still face in our research. Arguably, we need a dialogue that crosses disciplines and theoretical approaches, with perspectives and traditions from Aboriginal history, feminist theory, and labor studies informing and challenging each other. There are transnational trends and shared perspectives in Aboriginal women's history that cross the 49th parallel; however, we also need to identify how and why national and regional histories and interpretations diverge. Still, one transnational commonality highlighted in this paper is the close connection between politics and research, between the present and the past: the questions posed by scholars have been stimulated and inspired by Aboriginal thought and organizing, and Aboriginal politics have benefited from scholarly research. Although research may still be difficult and contested terrain in Aboriginal\u2013non-Aboriginal relations (Smith 1999; Biolsi and Zimmerman 1997), there is hope that scholarly dialogue might contribute productively to decolonization.  --From Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "The essays in [this book] create a transnational and comparative dialogue on the history of the productive and reproductive lives and circumstances of Indigenous women from the late nineteenth century to the present in the United States, Australia, New Zealand/Aotearoa, and Canada. Surveying the spectrum of Indigenous women's lives and circumstances as workers, both waged and unwaged, the contributors offer varied perspectives on the ways women's work has contributed to the survival of communities in the face of ongoing tensions between assimilation and colonization. They also interpret how individual nations have conceived of Indigenous women as workers and, in turn, convert these assumptions and definitions into policy and practice. The essays address the intersection of Indigenous, women's, and labor history, but will also be useful to contemporary policy makers, tribal activists, and Native American women's advocacy associations. --Publisher's website.",

        "abstractNote": "Despite being dubbed \"the world's oldest profession,\" prostitution has rarely been viewed as a legitimate form of labour. Instead, it has been criminalized, sensationalized, and polemicized across the socio-political spectrum by everyone from politicians to journalists to women's groups. Interest in and concern over sex work is not grounded in the lived realities of those who work in the industry, but rather in inflammatory ideas about who is participating, how they wound up in this line of work, and what form it takes. In Selling Sex, Emily van der Meulen, Elya M. Durisin, and Victoria Love present a more nuanced, balanced, and realistic view of the sex industry. They bring together a vast collection of voices - including researchers, feminists, academics, and advocates, as well as sex workers of differing ages, genders, and sectors - to engage in a dialogue that challenges the dominant narratives surrounding the sex industry and advances the idea that sex work is in fact work. Presenting a variety of opinions and perspectives on such diverse topics as the social stigma of sex work, police violence, labour organizing, anti-prostitution feminism, human trafficking, and harm reduction, Selling Sex is an eye-opening, challenging, and necessary book. --Publisher's  description",

        "abstractNote": "This essay will initiate an assessment of the literature that actually seeks to explain the economic relationships between Natives and Whites. This review is not a detailed empirical study of a particular aspect of Native economic history or a demonstration of the immediate relevance of economic history. Instead, the present-day need for an accessible account, summary and analysis of the existing economic history literature and a critical evaluation of this disparate body of work will be addressed by this essay. By summarizing and reviewing this disparate literature, a rough chronology of Native economic history can trace major changes. Innovative studies using interesting data sources and methods will be highlighted. The examination of economic history before 1870 will focus on the fur trade to consider exchange relations, racial stratification, credit, and resource management problems. The period following 1870 will consider how the social overhead of the fur trade became a government responsibility. --From Introduction",

Some people now find it desirable \u2013 or even necessary \u2013 to work from home. Others are expected to spend more time travelling to and from the workplace than they actually spend doing their job. How do changes in the way we work affect every other aspect of 21st century life? Seven years ago, a large group of interdisciplinary scholars from all parts of Canada (and beyond) began researching 'work-related mobility' with a project called the On the Move Partnership. Paul Kennedy was there from the beginning creating documentaries based on the research. As the project nears completion, Paul speaks to the participants about their conclusions in this final episode of On The Move.  --Website description",

        "abstractNote": "The history of Aboriginal-settler interactions in Canada continues to haunt the national imagination. Despite billions of dollars spent on the \"Indian problem,\" Aboriginal people remain the poorest in the country. Because the stereotype of the \"lazy Indian\" is never far from the surface, many Canadians wonder if the problem lay with \"Indians\" themselves. John Lutz traces Aboriginal people's involvement in the new economy, and their displacement from it, from the first arrival of Europeans to the 1970s. Drawing upon oral histories, manuscripts, newspaper accounts, biographies, and statistical analysis, Lutz shows that Aboriginal people flocked to the workforce and prospered in the late 19th century. The roots of today's wide-spread unemployment and \"welfare dependency\" date only from the 1950s, when deliberate and inadvertent policy choices--what Lutz terms the \"white problem\"--drove Aboriginal people out of the capitalist, wage, and subsistence economies, offering them welfare as \"compensation.\" -- Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "In the late nineteenth century, thousands of Indigenous women journeyed hundreds of miles annually along the Pacific Northwest coast and converged around Puget Sound. They came to pick hops in the fields of farmers who occupied lands in western Washington. These migrants did not look like modern factory workers, yet they were laborers in a late-nineteenth-century incarnation of industrial agriculture. They came en masse to harvest a cash crop destined for sale on the global market, a crop internationally sought as a preservative and fl avoring for beer, a crop that could provide no sustenance to them or their families. Field workers were paid in cash wages, not in kind. This was no shop floor, but a labor hierarchy (both racialized and gendered) structured the conditions of their work all the same. --Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "When dealing with Indigenous women\u2019s history we are conditioned to think about women as private-sphere figures, circumscribed by the home, the reserve, and the community. Moreover, in many ways Indigenous men and women have been cast in static, pre-modern, and one-dimensional identities, and their twentieth century experiences reduced to a singular story of decline and loss. In Indigenous Women, Work, and History, historian Mary Jane Logan McCallum rejects both of these long-standing conventions by presenting case studies of Indigenous domestic servants, hairdressers, community health representatives, and nurses working in \u201cmodern Native ways\u201d between 1940 and 1980.\n\nBased on a range of sources including the records of the Departments of Indian Affairs and National Health and Welfare, interviews, and print and audio-visual media, McCallum shows how state-run education and placement programs were part of Canada\u2019s larger vision of assimilation and extinguishment of treaty obligations. Conversely, she also shows how Indigenous women link these same programs to their social and cultural responsibilities of community building and state resistance. By placing the history of these modern workers within a broader historical context of Aboriginal education and health, federal labour programs, post-war Aboriginal economic and political developments, and Aboriginal professional organizations, McCallum challenges us to think about Indigenous women\u2019s history in entirely new ways. --Publisher's description.",

When and where and for what reasons have Indigenous people worked for wages and been union members and how have they fared in these roles? In this short paper we examine a wide range of recent studies that have looked at various aspects of these questions. In particular, we examine the role that unions have played with Indigenous wage workers, and with Indigenous people who have sought to work for wages, and we consider some recent initiatives that unions have taken to meet the needs of Indigenous workers. Such efforts are especially significant in an era when the numbers of Indigenous workers entering the labour market are growing rapidly, and when the labour force as a whole is becoming increasingly diverse.  --Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "In conventional histories of the Canadian prairies, Native people disappear from view after the Riel rebellions. In a fresh departure from traditional studies, Frank Tough examines the role of Native people, both Indian and Metis, in the economy of northern Manitoba from 1870 to the Depression. He argues that they did not become economically obsolete but rather played an important role in the transitional era between the mercantile fur trade and the emerging industrial economy of the mid-twentieth century. Tough reconstructs the traditional economy of the fur trade era and examines its evolution through reserve selection and settlement, scrip distribution, and the participation of Natives in the new resource industries of commercial fishing, transportation, and lumbering. His analysis clearly shows that Native people in northern Manitoba responded to the challenge of an expanding market economy in rational and enterprising ways, but that they were repeatedly obstructed by government policy. --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "This essay examines Aboriginal longshoremen, most of whom belonged to the Squamish First Nation, on Burrard Inlet, British Columbia, from 1863 to 1939. Beginning with a consideration of the Squamish adaptation to wage labour in the mid-to-late nineteenth century, this essay analyses the ways in which Aboriginal workers negotiated the daily demands of waterfront work. Their encounter with the work process, labour politics, welfare capitalism, and class conflict are studied in depth. Despite intense competition from non-Aboriginal workers for limited job opportunities, Aboriginal longshoremen worked on Burrard inlet for a long period of time; in addition to the daily demands of waterfront work, this essay also explores the strategies that Squamish dockers adopted to protect their positions on the waterfront. Often mentioned in the scholarly literature, but never studied in a systematic way, the 'Indian'waterfront provides a window into the importance of waged work to Aboriginal people on Burrard Inlet and the sophisticated ways that the Squamish responded to Canadian colonialism and capitalism.",

It counters the common misconception that native people responded to European settlement and industrial development by retreating to a reserve existence. Evidence amassed from logging, transport, construction, longshoring, commercial fishing and canning, and a host of other industries shows that native Indians played a significant role in British Columbia's economy from the moment the first European explorers appeared off the coast. --Publisher's description",

The paper will also show the nature of Indian women's subjugation, a subjugation taken to establish the fur trade. Class, racial and sexist divisions came to be imposed upon the Indigenous Indian population through colonial relations based upon a particular of exploitation.",

        "abstractNote": "Established in August 1991, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was tasked with a broad range of issues, many of which are complex and deal with long standing matters in the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in Canada. The Commission's investigation covered a broad spectrum of the Aboriginal experience in Canada including: the history of the relations between Aboriginal peoples, the Canadian government, and Canadian society as a whole; the recognition of self government; the land base for Aboriginal peoples; the constitutional responsibilities of the Canadian Crown toward Aboriginal peoples and the legal position of the Metis and off-reserve Indians.

        "abstractNote": "Except for the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) which employed black cooks and waiters in its dining cars, Canadian railway companies employed blacks almost exclusively as sleeping car porters from the late 1880s until the amalgamation of the dining car and poerters' locals of the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Transport and General Workers (CBRT) in 1964. The process of forming an ethnically submerged split labour market was completed in the 1920s when the Canadian National Railways (CNR) took over the GTR and replaced black waiters in the dining cars on fomer GTR cars with white employees. Moreover, the company and the CBRT agreed to a group classification system which restricted blacks to being porters only. The Canadian Pacific Railway's policies of importing Americna porters from the United Sates and of stifling porters' efforts to organize were instrumental in creating a double split labour market. The Canada Fair Employment Practices Act in 1953, however, gave proters the leverage they need to combat discrimination in railway employment. The data came from oral history, organizational records, government documents and other secondary sources.",

Clare Pentland's Labour and Capital in Canada 1650-1860 is a seminal work that analyzes the shaping of the Canadian working class and the evolution of capitalism in Canada.Pentland's work focuses on the relationship between the availability and nature of labour and the development of industry. From that idea flows an absorbing account that explores patterns of labour, patterns of immigration and the growth of industry. Pentland writes of the massive influx of immigrants to Canada in the 1800s--taciturn highland Scots who eked out a meagre living on subsistence farms; shrewd lowlanders who formed the basis of an emerging business class; skilled English artisans who brought their trades and their politics to the new land; Americans who took to farming; and Irish who came in droves, fleeing the poverty and savagery of an Ireland under the heel of Britain.Labour and Capital in Canada is a classic study of the peoples who built Canada in the first two centuries of European occupation.",

Macdonald\u2019s \"National Dream. \"\n\nIt was a dream that came at great expense: the present disparity in health and economic well-being between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations, and the lingering racism and misunderstanding that permeates the national consciousness to this day.\n\nThis new edition of Clearing the Plains has a foreword by Pulitzer Prize winning author, Elizabeth Fenn, an opening by Niigaanwewidam James Sinclair, and explanations of the book\u2019s influence by leading Canadian historians. -- Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "Indigenous North Americans continue to be overrepresented among those who are poor, unemployed, and with low levels of education. This has long been an issue of concern for Indigenous people and their allies and is now drawing the attention of government, business leaders, and others who know that this fast-growing population is a critical source of future labour. Shauna MacKinnon's Decolonizing Employment: Aboriginal Inclusion in Canada's Labour Market is a case study with lessons applicable to communities throughout North America. Her examination of Aboriginal labour market participation outlines the deeply damaging, intergenerational effects of colonial policies and describes how a neoliberal political economy serves to further exclude Indigenous North Americans. MacKinnon's work demonstrates that a fundamental shift in policy is required. Long-term financial support for comprehensive, holistic education and training programs that integrate cultural reclamation and small supportive learning environments is needed if we are to improve social and economic outcomes and support the spiritual and emotional healing that Aboriginal learners tell us is of primary importance. --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "This thesis evolved out of an attempt to analyze aboriginal agency and resistance in the aftermath of the Mohawk conflict at Oka, Quebec, which took place in the summer of 1990. However, the existing political economy literature on aboriginal oppression founded in the \"staple theory\" outlined by Harold Adams Innis does not account for the historical significance of aboriginal resistance in Canada. The thesis undertakes a critique of the inherent assumptions in staple theory--its anthropologism, its fetish of the commodity form, and its geographical determinism--which effectively reduce aboriginal peoples to the position of passive victims in contemporary capitalist society. An alternative historiography is then proposed which considers Canadian economic and political development as the outcome of struggle. The agency of aboriginal peoples is understood in terms of their specific and changing historical position as producers, from the early fur trade to the forging of a capitalist economy and post-colonial state. If the rise of commodity wheat production is the key to the transition to capitalism in Canada, it follows that the aboriginal struggle to retain their land rights was an important obstacle to such development. The aboriginal struggle for land continues to be an obstacle to capitalist expansion; in the current context of economic integration under the North American Free Trade Agreement, such resistance has international implications. In the current climate of scapegoating and cutbacks which accompany the restructuring process, aboriginal aspirations for land and self-determination also coincide with the aims of other social movements to oppose such attacks. In fact, aboriginal self-determination is central to the broader project for social change in Canada.",

The second identifies nonwork variables as the critical determinant of workers' consciousness. Based on information collected from manual workers in two plants in Edmonton, Canada, the present research finds that neither perspective emerges as a significant determinant of worker ideology. The second part of the article addresses this issue and offers an explanation of the failure to account for much of the variation in workers' ideological thinking.",

Our starting point is the Karasek 'job strain' model. We argue that 'job strain' focuses on the health effects of work once people are employed. It is less effective in capturing the health effects associated with the employment relationship, the process by which workers acquire work, keep work and negotiate its terms and conditions. We develop a new construct, 'employment strain' to measure these aspects of work organisation. Evidence presented indicates employment strain is associated with poorer health outcomes.",

It is argued that the early interest in industrial democracy retarded the adoption of American methods that assumed a greater degree of managerial control over factory organization.",

The study is based on data collected from 38 firms which issued shares publicly or were required to publish balance sheets. These firms represent the majority of British firms engaged in the quantity production of motor vehicles. ...Our interest in the industry's financial history, and in particular, the return to capital of firms using British production techniques was stimulated by the long standing argument that since 1870 British levels of productivity have lagged behind others countries, particularly the United States. --Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "Did workplace characteristics, such as the degree of mechanization or the level of managerial control, systematically influence occupational mortality rates in France at the beginning of the 20th century? Data from an early 20th-century study of occupational mortality in France lead us to conclude that long hours of work, under conditions where labor had limited control of the pace of work, represented the most serious occupational risk facing early French workers. The effect of long hours of work on mortality dwarfed the impact of either mechanization or size of establishment.",

        "abstractNote": "We present some survey results on the preferences of workers for a coop as opposed to a private buy-out if faced with the closure of their workplace. Although there has been quite a lot of theoretical discussion of this issue there is relatively little empirical evidence. Although hedged about by reservations we conclude that the principal factor that determines preferences are the\u2018job risk\u2019 characteristics of the coop and the privately owned firm. To a very large extent a worker will prefer the coop to a private buy-out if it leads to increased job security and if the coop is considered to be viable. We also find that workers expected that everyone would work harder in the coop and that this, together with increased shop floor control of production, was expected to lead to higher earnings. Significantly, however, these expected differences in the work/earnings trade-off between the coop and the privately owned firm did not lead workers to prefer one to the other.",

In industries such as automobiles, the workforce remained predominantly male despite contemporary assessments that women could efficiently do many of these jobs. This article explores why. It is argued that employers such as Ford concluded that the conversion of labor time into effort would be more difficult in a mixed-gender workforce. The paper shows how Ford developed a fraternalist labor strategy, a men's club, whose objective was to accommodate men to monotony and maximize labor productivity.",

        "abstractNote": "The shift towards the internal responsibility system and the mandating of Joint Health and Safety Committees in the early 1980s represented a radical departure in terms of how health and safety were regulated in the workplace. This paper examines the effectiveness of this institutional change using firm level data provided by the Worker's Compensation Board on lost time accidents from 1976 to 1989. It finds that where management and labour had some sympathy for the co-management of health and safety through joint committees, the new system significantly reduced lost-time accident rates. At workplaces where either labour or management resisted the spread of co-management the mandating of committees appears to have little effect on lost-time accident rates.",

        "abstractNote": "We report the results of a questionnaire survey of manufacturing workplaces related to the lost-time frequency rates (LTFR) for Workers' Compensation claims. Six types of industry were chosen: metal articles, plastic articles, grain products, textile manufacturing, printing, and automobile manufacturing. LTFR were standardized by type of industry. Stratifying simultaneously by number of employees and LTFR category, we sampled 718 workplaces. A mail questionnaire to labor and management representatives provided at least some information on 58%. Response rates were similar across LTFR categories, and telephone interviews of non-responders showed little difference in their replies from those obtained in completed questionnaires. A large number of variables were examined. Apart from statistical significance, we looked for consistency in trends across LTFR categories and in patterns for similar questions. Significant associations grouped into several areas. Lower LTFR were associated with: concrete demonstration by management of its concern for the workforce; greater involvement of workers in general decision-making; greater willingness of the Joint Health and Safety Committee to solve problems internally; and greater experience of the workforce. Variables that were not significant included profitability and financial performance. A final stepwise multiple regression explained 19% of the variance in LTFR, although this analysis suffered from several limitations.",

The majority of benchmarking studies have little if anything to say about working conditions or the tradeoffs between productivity improvements and the conditions of working life. This article is based on a study which focuses on working conditions as described by workers, raising questions about the tradeoffs betwcen work reorganization and the quality of working life under Lean Production. The results, based on a survey of 1670 workers at 16 different companies, suggest that work life under Lean Production has not improved. Compared with workers in traditional Fordist style plants, those at Lean companies reported their work load was heavier and faster. They rcported work loads were increasing and becoming faster. They reported it was difficult to change things they did not like about their job and that it was becoming more difficult to get time off. While our survey results suggest that working in traditional Fordist plants is far from paradise, they also suggest that working in Lean plants is worse. At a minimum, our results should be viewed as a wake-up call to those who have painted a positive picture of work under Lean Production.",

The data is drawn from a survey of 5,635 Canadian automobile workers. Workers were asked questions about their work-load, health and safety conditions, empowerment, and relations with management. It examines what it is like to work in plants organized according to the principles of lean production and compares empowerment in lean plants and traditionally organized plants.",

Far from understanding these as exemplars of 'democratic Taylorism', the article identities spwific company responses to problems associated with declining productivity and competitiveness. Moreover, the article argues that new models of work organization associated with lean production, far from heralding empowerment, are more conerned with asserting management control in varying ways in different companies.",

        "abstractNote": "This report compares work organization and workload at three [Ontario] developmental service agencies in order to identify factors that precipitate and contribute to injuries, stress and health problems in the social services. The restructuring of services in this sector has resulted in reduced funding and therefore workloads and health risks associated with overwork and burnout appear to have increased dramatically in all three sites studied. Restructuring has also exposed workers and clients to higher levels of stress and violence. This study also uncovered serious incidents of workplace bullying and traumatic work cultures. While workplace bullying certainly predates restructuring, some studies show that it is a phenomena that has seen rapid growth within the context of restructured public sector and non profit workplaces. Given the serious under funding of this sector it may appear that there is little that can be done to improve health and safety in the short term. However, this report recommends several measures including an immediate increase in government funding, the incorporation of worker\u2019s knowledge into how work is to be organized and planned, guarantees to part-time workers of enough hours of work to support themselves, an end to the use of split shifts, a cap\non overtime and subsequent hiring additional fulltime staff in order to ensure workplace stability and the introduction of immediate, assertive, transparent measures to improve workplace morale and eradicate traumatic workplace cultures. --Executive Summary",

The assessment provides evidence in support of the union's claim that \"The employer is failing to make reasonable provisions for the health of its employees in the ODSP by failing to maintain sufficient staff to handle the workload required of its staff.\" --Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "L\u2019article propose une grille de lecture des transformations de la relation d\u2019emploi dans le cadre de la globalisation des march\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de la notion de \u00ab zone grise d\u2019emploi \u00bb (ZGE). Cette notion, forg\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019origine par le juriste A. Supiot, pour d\u00e9signer une convergence de situation entre l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9tat de subordination \u00bb des salari\u00e9s et des travailleurs ind\u00e9pendants est reprise et discut\u00e9e dans le cadre \u00e9largi d\u2019une \u00ab relation d\u2019emploi avec tiers \u00bb. Ce cas de figure renvoie \u00e0 un contexte d\u2019internationalisation de la production o\u00f9 la relation employ\u00e9-employeur ne se r\u00e9sume pas \u00e0 une relation de face \u00e0 face, mais d\u00e9pend d\u2019un ensemble de parties prenantes impliqu\u00e9es dans les conditions qui pr\u00e9sident \u00e0 son organisation et sa gestion. L\u2019article propose une d\u00e9finition de la ZGE qui ne se limite pas \u00e0 souligner un d\u00e9faut d\u2019institutionnalisation dans la r\u00e8gle de droit, mais consid\u00e8re que tout \u00ab \u00e9cart \u00e0 la norme \u00bb est devenu la r\u00e8gle et non plus l\u2019exception. La ZGE est d\u00e9finie comme \u00ab espace public \u00bb entendu comme un espace de d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration o\u00f9 les jeux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat et les relations de pouvoir se coordonnent ou se confrontent pour la constitution d\u2019un ordre de r\u00e9gulation hybride, public et priv\u00e9, formel et informel. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de cette notion est de porter un autre regard sur les transformations de la relation d\u2019emploi. En prenant la firme Uber comme exemple, l\u2019article montre que l\u2019on ne peut r\u00e9duire la question de l\u2019emploi des chauffeurs prestataires au paradigme juridique standard qui limiterait le d\u00e9bat entre choisir le statut de travailleur ind\u00e9pendant ou celui de salari\u00e9. La diversit\u00e9, mais aussi la fragilit\u00e9 des jugements prononc\u00e9s par les tribunaux, leurs caract\u00e8res partiels et toujours provisoires, laissent deviner que la situation socio-professionnelle des chauffeurs, si elle rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019\u00ab ind\u00e9cidable \u00bb au plan du droit, ne peut \u00eatre comprise sans prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019action des \u00c9tats, des territoires et de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile dans le jeu de la r\u00e9gulation.",

        "abstractNote": "I) Objective: The study aimed to explore the health effects of precarious employment relationships in Ontario, and understand how various forms of support shape health. II) Methods: Three measures make up our \"Employment Strain\" model: employment relationship uncertainty; employment relationship effort; and, employment relationship support. This new framework was used to measure the characteristics of precarious employment and their effect on health using data from a structured, self-administered, population-based survey completed by 3,244 workers, and 82 semi-structured interviews using a stratified sampling technique to select participants. III) Results: Precarious employment has negative health consequences for many workers. However, the relationship between precarious employment and health is complex, whereby the characteristics of the employment relationship and levels of support determine health outcomes. Using the \"Employment Strain\" framework, we found that workers exposed to High Employment Strain - workers with high levels of employment relationship uncertainty and high levels of employment relationship effort - have poorer health. Importantly, support does shapes health and can help to buffer the health risks associated with precarious employment.",

        "abstractNote": "This report is a study of occupational health and safety conditions at Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) offices in the wake of two sets of changes: The reorganization of work associated with the Modernized Service Delivery Model (MSDM) introduced in 2010 (commonly referred to as Modernization), and the 2014 implementation of the Social Assistance Management System, a new computer system knowns as SAMS. As I crossed Ontario interviewing ODSP workers and read dozens of pages of comments workers added to their online survey, I heard and read numerous stories of frustration and disappointment with the changes, frustrations that were negatively affecting the health of workers. However, I also heard how many ODSP workers had been looking forward to these changes.",

        "abstractNote": "The emergence of internationalized production in the context of weakening state regulation of labour rights and of increasing employer dominance in industrial relations systems raises significant questions about the nature and future of worker representation. A crucial issue is the transferability of company-specific models of worker voice across national boundaries. This issue is the focus of this case study of Magna International, a leading member of a small group of transnational automotive parts manufacturing firms that are central to the contemporary restructuring of the international automotive industry. The paper compares the transformation of worker representation at Magna in Canada and Mexico. In crossing international borders, the Magna industrial relations model has taken on national and local features of the host country. However, the underlying industrial relations structure is one which has elicited a successful reconfiguration and containment of much, although by no means all, of the adversarialism inherent in labour-management relations. This reconfiguration has aligned worker representation to an essentially unitarist project oriented to management's productivity goals. More than merely suppressing independent unions, Magna has constructed a coherent, management--dominated model of worker representation in both Canada and Mexico. The paper concludes with an assessment of the implications of this model for independent unionism.",

        "abstractNote": "From the end of the Second World War to the early 1980s, the North American norm was that men had full-time jobs, earned a \"family wage,\" and expected to stay with the same employer for life. In households with children, most women were unpaid caregivers. This situation began to change in the mid-1970s as two-earner households became commonplace, with women entering employment through temporary and part-time jobs. Since the 1980s, less permanent precarious employment has increasingly become the norm for all workers.\n\nWorking Without Commitments offers a new understanding of the social and health impacts of this change in the modern workplace, where outsourcing, limited term contracts, and the elimination of pensions and health benefits have become the new standard. Using information from interviews and surveys with workers in less permanent employment, the authors show how precarious employment affects the health of workers, labour productivity, and the sustainability of the traditional family model.\n\nA timely and relevant work for uncertain economic times, Working Without Commitments provides helpful information for understanding the present workplace and securing better futures for today's workforce. --Publisher's description",

This was one component of the transition to an Internal Responsibility System that included mandated Joint Health and Safety Committees, right to know regulations, and the right to refuse dangerous work. Very little has changed in this regulatory framework in the ensuing three decades. The effectiveness of these regulations in improving health and safety was contentious in the 1970s and continues to be debated. Earlier work by Lewchuk et al. (1996) argued that the labour-management environment of individual workplaces influenced the effectiveness of worker representatives and Joint Health and Safety Committees. In particular, the framework was more effective where labour was organised and where management had accepted a philosophy of co-management of the health and safety function. The Canadian economy has experienced significant reorganisation since the 1970s. Canadian companies in general face more intense competition because of trade deals entered into in the 1980s and 1990s. Exports represent a much larger share of GNP. Union density has fallen and changes in legislation make it more difficult to organise workers. Non-standard employment, self-employment and other forms of less permanent employment have all grown in relative importance. This chapter presents new evidence on how these changes are undermining the effectiveness of the Internal Responsibility System in Canada, with a particular focus on workers in precarious employment relationships. Data is drawn from a recent population survey of non-student workers in Ontario conducted by the authors.",

The contrasting views of the AFL-CIO and CLC, it is argued, arise not simply from differing levels of commitment to the principles of social unionism, but from a more complex mesh of ideological, pragmatic, and institutional factors related to union-party relationships and other important differences pertaining to the culture, membership composition, organizational maintenance requirements, and decision-making power bases in both labor organizations.",

Central to the account is the persistent effort by workers, women in the community and other activists to gain recognition of health hazards in the mines, their effects on workers and to obtain adequate compensation for victims and their families.  --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "Objective: We examined disparities in hazardous employment characteristics and working conditions among Chinese and white workers in Toronto, Canada.Design. We used self-administered questionnaire data from a 2005\u20132006 population-based survey (n = 1611). Using modified Poisson regression, we examined the likelihood for Chinese workers of experiencing adverse exposures compared to whites. Models were stratified by sex and adjusted for differences in human capital. Work sector was conceptualized as a mediating variable.Results. Chinese workers were generally more likely to report adverse exposures. In many cases, disparities were only evident or more pronounced among women. The shorter length of time in Canada of Chinese relative to whites accounted for some of the observed disparities. Meanwhile, the higher educational level of Chinese compared to whites provided them with no protection from adverse exposures. The risk of experiencing discrimination on the labor market and at work was more than 50% higher among Chinese men and women as compared to whites, and those disparities, though reduced, persisted after adjustment for confounders.Conclusions. Discrimination is far more prevalent among Chinese than among whites and may explain their disproportionate exposure to other hazards.",

        "abstractNote": "Background: Although worker representation in OHS has been widely recognized as contributing to health and safety improvements at work, few studies have examined the role that worker representatives play in this process. Using a large quantitative sample, this paper seeks to confirm findings from an earlier exploratory qualitative study that worker representatives can be differentiated by the knowledge intensive tactics and strategies that they use to achieve changes in their workplace. Methods: Just under 900 worker health and safety representatives in Ontario completed surveys which asked them to report on the amount of time they devoted to different types of representation activities (i.e., technical activities such as inspections and report writing vs. political activities such as mobilizing workers to build support), the kinds of conditions or hazards they tried to address through their representation (e.g., housekeeping vs. modifications in ventilation systems), and their reported success in making positive improvements. A cluster analysis was used to determine whether the worker representatives could be distinguished in terms of the relative time devoted to different activities and the clusters were then compared with reference to types of intervention efforts and outcomes. Results: The cluster analysis identified three distinct groupings of representatives with significant differences in reported types of interventions and in their level of reported impact. Two of the clusters were consistent with the findings in the exploratory study, identified as knowledge activism for greater emphasis on knowledge based political activity and technical-legal representation for greater emphasis on formalized technical oriented procedures and legal regulations. Knowledge activists were more likely to take on challenging interventions and they reported more impact across the full range of interventions. Conclusions This paper provides further support for the concepts of knowledge activism and technical-legal representation when differentiating the strategic orientations and impact of worker health and safety representatives, with important implications for education, political support and recruitment.",

The IRS gives workers rights, or \u201cvoice,\u201d to manage, know about, and refuse unsafe working conditions. I present new evidence that worker voice and the IRS have weakened with the decline of unions and the rise of precarious employment. Survey data are analyzed from Ontario workers who rated the likelihood that raising a health and safety concern with their current employer would negatively affect their future employment. My analysis models how workers\u2019 sex, race, unionization, sector, and degree of employment precarity affect their probability of exercising voice. Results of a logistic regression suggest the most precariously employed are the least likely to use voice. Consequently, I argue that the IRS should be supplemented with more external oversight in sectors where employment is most insecure.",

        "abstractNote": "Drawing on qualitative interview data from case studies in Scotland and Canada in the post 2008 era, this article explores the impact of austerity policies on the conditions and experience of employment in two nonprofit social service agencies and their shifting labour process. Despite differences in context, the article finds a similarity of experience of austerity-compelled precarity at several levels in the agency. This precarity increased management control and evoked little resistance from employees. These findings contribute to our understanding of austerity as articulated differently in different contexts, but experienced similarly at the front lines of care work.",

However, official labour market data have not shown a dramatic increase in temporary or casual employment. This article takes a new look at the changing characteristics of employment and offers a new method to measure employment security: the Employment Precarity Index. We use the Employment Precarity Index to assess how insecure employment associated with a \u2018gig\u2019 economy might affect well-being and social relations, including health outcomes, household well-being and community involvement.",

For the most part, this is the story of unorganized workers who face their employers without the protection of a formal union. The main focus of this study is the individualized, informal, and under-the-radar strategies that workers employ to shape workplace outcomes, and how these strategies might translate into broader collective action.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper explores the impact of precarious employment relationships on health outcomes. It uses a novel framework, \u201cEmployment Strain\u201d to describe the characteristics of different employment relationships and how they impact health outcomes. It uses interview data and comments provided on a survey to explore these issues. The paper begins by exploring if the health effects reported by mid-career individuals in precarious employment are different from those of younger and older workers. Finding limited evidence to support this hypothesis, the paper goes on to explore in detail the conditions under which precarious employment does increase stress and tension and impact health outcomes. It concludes that a combination of an individual's desire for more permanent employment, the expectation that permanent employment will be found, and the support individuals receive from various sources are critical to understanding the health effects of precarious employment.",

In addition to analyzing how Canada\u2019s largest labour organization has approached issues of national unity, federalism, and constitutional reform, the article underscores how Canadian constitutional struggles were reflected within the labour movement by focusing on how constitutional politics affected the relationship between the CLC and its Qu\u00e9bec affiliate, the (Qu\u00e9bec Federation of Labour) FTQ. Specifically, the article traces the gradual eclipse of the CLC\u2019s preference for centralization and the emergence of sovereignty-association as a political position which the CLC has both externalized politically and internalized organizationally.",

        "abstractNote": "The Quebec labour movement's decision to withdraw its support for Canada's federal system in the 1970s and instead embrace the sovereignist option was unquestionably linked to the intersection of class and nation in Quebec. In this period, unions saw the sovereignist project as part of a larger socialist or social democratic societal project. Because the economic inequalities related to ethnic class, which fuelled the labour movement's support for sovereignty in the 1970s, were no longer as prevalent by the time of Quebec's 1995 referendum, organized labour's continued support for the sovereignist option in the post-referendum period cannot adequately be explained using the traditional lens of class and nation. This paper employs an institutional comparative analysis of Quebec's three largest trade union centrals with a view to demonstrating that organized labour's primary basis for supporting sovereignty has changed considerably over time. While unions have not completely abandoned a class-based approach to the national question, they have tended to downplay class division in favour of an emphasis on Quebec's uniqueness and the importance of preserving the collective francophone identity of the nation. Party\u2013union relations, the changing cultural, political and economic basis of the sovereignist project and the emergence of neoliberalism in Quebec are offered as key explanatory factors for the labour movement's shift in focus.",

        "abstractNote": "he Canadian labour movement has undergone several fundamental changes in response to demands for greater inclusion and representation by women, visible and sexual minorities, and people with disabilities. Equity, Diversity, and Canadian Labour explores the specific challenges put to outmoded conceptions of labour, charting the effort made towards establishing a more inclusive vision of labour in Canada. The study concludes that the Canadian labour movement has seen a fair amount of progress in this regard, though it still faces persistent impediments to equity and suffers from an uneven responsiveness within and across diversity issues. This collection of original essays brings together contributors from a variety of backgrounds womens studies, political science, sociology, industrial relations, and the labour movement itself. They provide detailed analyses of significant changes in union policies, practices, and cultures as viewed through different disciplinary lenses. With reference to gender, race, disability, and sexuality, the volume assesses the status of labour diversity in Canada and suggests what still needs to be done to advance the equity project. --Publisher's description.",

        "abstractNote": "In the wake of a series of prolabor Supreme Court decisions in Canada, the mantra of \u201cworkers' rights as human rights\u201d has gained unprecedented attention in the Canadian labor movement. This article briefly reviews the Canadian labor movement's recent history with the Supreme Court before arguing that elite-driven judicial strategies, advocated by several academics and Canadian unions, threaten, over time, to depoliticize traditional class-based approaches to advancing workers' rights. The argument is premised on the notion that liberal human rights discourse does little to address the inequalities in wealth and power that polarize Canadian society along class lines.",

Whereas the NDP was widely considered the political arm of the labor movement during the Keynesian post-war period, under neoliberalism, the relationship between most unions and the NDP has become more tactical and less cohesive. This article surveys contemporary party-union relationships in Canada, at both the federal and provincial levels, with a view to demonstrating that weakening party-union relations are rooted in larger macro-economic and political transformations and are shaped by factors related to region and language.",

        "abstractNote": "Nuclear energy is one of the predominant false solutions being offered up by contemporary capitalism's power elite in a futile effort to reconcile the goal of environmental sustainability with limitless growth, profit, and accumulation. Incorporating environmental needs into the economy ultimately means not only developing new eco-friendly products and technologies, but changing everything about how people produce and consume and how they travel and live. To this end, the contemporary labor movement needs to increasingly put its own independent and proactive vision of progress and ecological transformation on the table instead of simply allying with employers and perpetuating its dependence upon existing structures of production and consumption. The Canadian Nuclear Workers Council's (CNWC) alliance with the nuclear industry reflects not only the organization's stake in protecting jobs, but also its inability and unwillingness to challenge the deceptive employment versus environment discourse and the dominant mode of economic growth.",

The case study examines both the impetus for unionization and the strategies employed by the faculty association in support of certification with a view to demonstrating how discourses of professionalism and collegiality can be challenged, subverted, and redeployed by academics intent on organizing, mobilizing, and ultimately winning support for unionization.",

        "abstractNote": "This study examines the views of full-time unionized university faculty at four primarily undergraduate universities in Ontario, Canada, on a broad range of issues related to postsecondary education, faculty associations, and the labor movement. The purpose of the study is twofold: first, to better understand the views of unionized professors regarding the role and effectiveness of their faculty unions and of labor unions more generally, and second to explore what impact such views might have on shaping the strategic orientation and political priorities of faculty associations in a context of unprecedented austerity measures and neoliberal restructuring in Ontario's postsecondary education sector. Based on the findings of a mixed-methods survey, we found that university professors were relatively satisfied union members with a healthy degree of union\u2014as opposed to class\u2014consciousness, but had little appetite for engaging in political activities beyond the narrow scope of postsecondary education. This finding, we argue, reinforces the false division between the \u201ceconomic\u201d and the \u201cpolitical\u201d in the realm of labor strategy, thus potentially undermining the capacity of unionized faculty associations to effectively resist neoliberal restructuring both on campus and in society more broadly.",

The purpose of the study is twofold: first, to assess the level of opposition to such legislative initiatives among unionized faculty, and, second, to determine the extent to which the passage of such laws would undermine the dues base of the faculty union.

Pearson International Airport in Toronto, a small but significant group of worker-organizers has created the Toronto Airport Workers\u2019 Council (TAWC), a nonunion organization open to all Pearson workers. In this paper, we discuss the capitalist context of Canadian labor relations and the neoliberal restructuring that has attacked working conditions and workers\u2019 solidarity across the airline industry. Then, after examining the insufficient responses by the twelve Pearson unions, we explain how workers formed the TAWC, whose participatory structures, direct action strategy, and broader class focus have achieved considerable successes, despite tensions with union leaders wary of potential \u201cdual unionism.\u201d We also discuss how the TAWC provides a space for socialist-led workplace organizing training and political education by the Toronto Labour Committee. Finally, we explore the possible roles of this council model in labor movement renewal and labor education in socialist movement renewal.",

        "abstractNote": "Disputes over the meaning of human trafficking, forced labour and modern slavery have both provoked and coincided with a reinvigorated debate in academic and policy literatures about how to conceptualise unfree labour. This article traces the contours of the debate over free and unfree labour, identifying its key stakes as the debate has developed and paying particular attention to recent interventions. It begins by identifying a problem common to both canonical liberal and Marxian approaches to the free/unfree labour distinction, which is to fetishise the labour market. It then discusses the consensus that is emerging across disciplines and in leading international organisations that labour unfreedom in contemporary capitalism is best conceptualised as a continuum rather than a binary, highlighting recent disciplinary-specific contributions. It argues that the metaphor of a continuum of labour unfreedom obscures more than it illuminates. Drawing upon the growing body of literature that advocates a multifaceted approach to labour unfreedom, this article argues that a robust concept of local labour control regime does a much better job of capturing the complex mix of consent and coercion involved in extracting value from labour power than the idea of a continuum of labour unfreedom.",

This article explores the impact and legacy of BC Health Services, and finds that while workers\u2019 constitutional rights have been expanded under the Charter over the past decade, governments nevertheless continue to violate these rights. It concludes that the legacy of the case is not an enhanced level of protection for these rights to be enjoyed fully, but rather that the default option has been and will continue to be a financial penalty for the state in instances in which they violate workers\u2019 rights.",

In recent years, the intensity of state-led attacks against public sector workers has reached a fevered pitch, raising the question of the role of public sector unions in protecting their members and the broader public interest. Public Sector Unions in the Age of Austerity examines the unique characteristics of public sector unionism in a Canadian context. Contributors to this multi-disciplinary collection explore both the strategic possibilities and challenges facing public sector unions that are intent on resisting austerity, enhancing their power and connecting their interests as workers with those of citizens who desire a more just and equitable public sphere.  --Publisher's description.",

        "abstractNote": "This article explores the contradictions in the Canadian Auto Workers Union\u2019s (CAW) approach to environmental issues, particularly climate change. Despite being one of the Canadian labor movement\u2019s leading proponents of social unionism\u2014 understood as a union ethos committed to working-class interests beyond the workplace, and a strategic repertoire that involves community-union alliances\u2014 the CAW\u2019s environmental activism demonstrates the contradictory way that social unionism can be understood and practiced by unions. Through a critical discourse analysis of CAW policy documents and leadership statements, we show the union has not reframed its bargaining demands to emphasize both economically and environmentally sustainable production. Instead, the CAW\u2019s relatively uncritical defense of the North American auto industry and the jobs it provides, despite the clearly negative role such production plays in the climate crisis, its acceptance of the structures of automobility, and its emphasis on environmental issues that have little to do with the nature of their industry, indicates the way that social unionism can be an add-on rather than a fundamental reorientation of a union\u2019s role and purpose. We argue that, for social unionist environmental activism to be effective, the CAW must incorporate social unionist goals and analyses into their bargaining priorities, and confront the contradictions between their members\u2019 interests as autoworkers, on the one hand, and as workers and global citizens who require economically and environmentally sustainable livelihoods, on the other.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper examines the effect of Inuit and Innu women\u2019s participation in environmental assessment (EA) processes on EA recommendations, impact benefit agreement (IBA) negotiations, and women\u2019s employment experiences at Voisey\u2019s Bay Mine, Labrador. The literature on Indigenous participation in EAs has been critiqued for being overly process oriented and for neglecting to examine how power influences EA decision making. In this regard, two issues have emerged as critical to participation in EAs: how EA processes are influenced by other institutions that may help or hinder participation and whether EAs enable marginalized groups within Indigenous communities to influence development outcomes. To address these issues we examine the case of the Voisey\u2019s Bay Nickel Mine in Labrador, in which Indigenous women\u2019s groups made several collective submissions pertaining to employment throughout the EA process. We compare the submissions that Inuit and Innu women\u2019s groups made to the EA panel in the late 1990s to the final EA recommendations and then compare these recommendations to employment-related provisions in the IBA. Finally we compare IBA provisions to workers\u2019 perceptions of gender relations at the mine in 2010. Semi-structured interviews revealed that, notwithstanding the recommendations by women\u2019s groups concerning employment throughout the EA process, women working at the site experienced gendered employment barriers similar to those experienced by women in mining elsewhere. We suggest that the ineffective translation of EA submissions into EA regulations and the IBA, coupled with persistent masculinity within the mining industry, weakened the effect of women\u2019s requests for a comprehensive program to hire and train Indigenous women.",

        "abstractNote": "The Working Centre in the downtown core of Kitchener, Ontario, is a widely recognized and successful model for community development. Begun from scratch in 1982, it is now a vast network of practical supports for the unemployed, the underemployed, the temporarily employed, and the homeless, populations that collectively constitute up to 30 percent of the labour market both locally and across North America. Transition to Common Work is the essential text about The Working Centre--its beginnings thirty years ago, the lessons learned, and the myriad ways in which its strategies and innovations can be adapted by those who share its goals. The Working Centre focuses on creating access-to-tools projects rather than administrative layers of bureaucracy. This book highlights the core philosophy behind the centre's decentralized but integrated structure, which has contributed to the creation of affordable services. Underlying this approach are common-sense innovations such as thinking about virtues rather than values, developing community tools with a social enterprise approach, and implementing a radically equal salary policy. For social workers, activists, bureaucrats, and engaged citizens in third-sector organizations (NGOs, charities, not-for-profits, co-operatives), this practical and inspiring book provides a method for moving beyond the doldrums of \"poverty relief\" into the exciting world of community building. --Publisher's website.",

Next, relying on a combination of research interviews, quantitative data, and literature, contributors present an international comparative review of Canada's evolving criminal record legislation; the promotive features of employment; the complex constraints and stigma former prisoners encounter as they seek employment; and the individual and societal benefits of assisting former prisoners attain \"gainful\" employment. A main theme throughout is the interrelationship between employment and other central conditions necessary for safety and sustenance.  [The] book offers suggestions for criminal record policy amendments and new reintegration practices that would assist individuals in the search for employment. Using the evidence and research findings of practitioners and scholars in social work, criminology and law, psychology, and other related fields, the contributors concentrate on strategies that will reduce the stigma of having been in prison; foster supportive relationships between social and legal agencies and prisons and parole systems; and encourage individually tailored resources and training following release of individuals.  --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "In [this book],  Jean Barman rewrites the history of the Pacific Northwest from the perspective of French Canadians involved in the fur economy, the indigenous women whose presence in their lives encouraged them to stay, and their descendants. Joined in this distant setting by Quebec paternal origins, the French language, and Catholicism, French Canadians comprised Canadians from Quebec, Iroquois from the Montreal area, and metis combining Canadian and indigenous descent. For half a century, French Canadians were the largest group of newcomers in this region extending from Oregon and Washington east into Montana and north through British Columbia. Here, they facilitated the early overland crossings, drove the fur economy, initiated non-wholly-indigenous agricultural settlement, eased relations with indigenous peoples, and ensured that, when the Pacific Northwest was divided in 1846, the northern half would go to Britain, giving today's Canada its Pacific shoreline. In the generations that followed, Barman argues, descendants did not become Metis, as the term has been used to describe a people apart, but rather drew on both their French Canadians and indigenous inheritances to make the best possible lives for themselves and those around them. --Publisher's description",

Results show that while gender segregation was principally by occupation, segregation by Aboriginal ancestry was principally by industry sub-sector. White women were over represented in clerical occupations and Aboriginal men were over represented in woods based industries. Patterns of employment for Aboriginal women differed from those of both Aboriginal men and white women.",

        "abstractNote": "The inclusion of new groups of workers has been an important component of union renewal efforts. Sev- eral unions in Canada have begun to dedicate significant resources to better organize and represent Aboriginal workers. Drawing on interviews with union activists, organizers and representatives from two national public sector unions in Canada, we present an overview of union strategies to engage with Aboriginal peoples. Results suggest that understanding the distinct territorial context of Aboriginal peo- ples\u2019 relationships to work and unions has been necessary to the success of these union strategies. This approach begins by drawing connections between Aboriginal peoples\u2019 present-day relationships to work and their prior occupancy of, and dispossession from, lands and resources. Because of the geographical specificity of how the colonial experience affected Aboriginal peoples\u2019 relationships to work and unions, unions have had to adopt non-normative approaches to their engagements with Aboriginal peoples. In workplaces where settlers were dominant, addressing racism in the workplace and gaining support for initiatives to hire and train Aboriginal workers were important. Alternatively, in Aboriginal workplaces, organizing was a priority. Here questions of union legitimacy have taken precedence and the focus of unions has been on partnership building. Most importantly, however, engagement with Aboriginal peo- ples has brought attention to the colonial practices within unions and helped to foster growing Aboriginal voice within the labour movement.",

First, I suggest that researchers approach Aboriginal peoples\u2019 relationships to the environment by supporting Aboriginal rights to lands and resources. Second, and related to this point, I raise the issue of the need for Aboriginal-controlled development in northern Aboriginal communities. Finally, I draw on a case study on Inuit and union participation in the creation of the Vale Inco, Voisey\u2019s Bay nickel mine in Labrador to discuss how the increasing prevalence of corporate-Aboriginal alliances is creating important challenges to union engagement that need to be addressed.",

        "abstractNote": "Aboriginal peoples in Canada are gaining influence in post-secondary education through Aboriginal-directed programs and policies in non-Aboriginal institutions. However, these gains have occurred alongside, and in some cases through, neoliberal reforms to higher education. This article explores the political consequences of the neoliberal institutionalization of First Nations empowerment for public sector unions and workers. We examine a case where the indigenization of a community college in British Columbia was embedded in neoliberal reforms that ran counter to the interests of academic instructors. Although many union members supported indigenization, many also possessed a deep ambivalence about the change. Neoliberal indigenization increased work intensity, decreased worker autonomy and promoted an educational philosophy that prioritized labour market needs over liberal arts. This example demonstrates how the integration of Aboriginal aspirations into neoliberal processes of reform works to rationalize public sector restructuring, constricting labour agency and the possibilities for alliances between labour and Aboriginal peoples.",

While women have a long history of employment in these resource sectors, surprisingly, their employment contributions and experiences have not been publicly discussed. The goal of this research was to make visible the employment experiences of rural women in these industries, particularly as rural women have fewer job opportunities than women living in cities. We describe issues faced by women working in the forestry and agri-food industries and recommend policies to enhance women\u2019s employment experiences.",

        "abstractNote": "This report was prepared for the Moose Cree First Nation. Employment opportunities figure prominently in the private agreements between First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis governments and the resource companies who want to develop on their territories. Resource companies and Indigenous leadership alike often see employment opportunities as a key way that local communities can benefit from resource-related development. Many early agreements, however, provided for entry-level positions but not for training that would lead to meaningful work that is well compensated for Indigenous communities. As a result, employment provisions in agreements often strive to provide greater detail about access to training and movement into higher skilled positions. Access to training is particularly critical in the construction sector, since jobs are short term and range from unskilled positions that have no upward mobility to registered tradespersons, foreman and superintendent positions. This report offers a detailed examination of how a negotiated agreement facilitated the training and employment of First Nations workers in the construction phase of the Lower Mattagami River Hydro River Project (LMRP) from 2010 to 2015.",

        "abstractNote": "Previous research has understood the migrations of gay men and other queer people  through a lens of identity development, whereby relocation is driven by processes of coming out and consuming particular urban amenities. Meanwhile, labour geographers have largely overlooked sexuality, seeking to understand work-related migration in relation to gender, race, citizenship and the collective organization of workers. Drawing on the migration narratives of gay-identified men living in Ottawa, Canada, and Washington, DC, USA, we argue that the norms governing gender and sexuality within various workplaces, economic sectors and locales continuously influence migration related to work and inextricably linked processes of social reproduction. In particular, we explain how the affective needs of gay workers both deflect them from and attract them to particular locales and workplaces. In their migration destinations, gay workers tend to also transform the norms of social reproduction within workplaces and sectors. While gay workers may use migration to successfully negotiate the uneven landscapes of inclusion and visibility in North America, their agency is also constrained by the ongoing of regulation of sexuality in both workplaces and social and community environments.",

Environmental assessment and labour policy and practices have been conventionally understood as distinct processes. Our investigations demonstrate that EAs play a significant, if indirect, role in Aboriginal efforts to regulate resource sector work. While Aboriginal communities increasingly rely upon private negotiations with development proponents to secure resource sector employment, participation in EA processes provides Aboriginal peoples a space to negotiate language around employment commitments and leverage to secure Aboriginal employment provisions in impact benefit agreements with project proponents.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper explores the spatial politics of racism and inter-worker competition through a case study of Indigenous employment during the construction of the Voisey\u2019s Bay mine in northern Labrador. Over the course of construction, the building and construction trades unions (BCTUs) sought to restrict the hiring of local Inuit and Innu workers by challenging the legitimacy of place-based entitlements to work. Inuit and Innu workers had preferential access to employment as a result of unresolved land claims and the ensuing Impact and Benefit Agreements (IBA) between the Voisey\u2019s Bay Nickel Company and both the Innu Nation and the Labrador Inuit Association. IBA provisions that local Inuit and Innu be hired preferentially ran counter to the unions\u2019 organizational structures and cultures, which privileged worker mobility and skill. The BCTUs used the geographic incompatibility between the scale of Indigenous claims and that of construction worker organization to justify a competitive approach to unionism and to veil racist portrayals of Innu and Inuit workers. By drawing out the relation between skill, racism and beliefs about entitlements to work, this paper explores how workers selectively use place-based and mobile identities to participate in inter-worker competition, reifying colonial patterns of labour mobility and labour market segmentation.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper looks at the \"deep roots\" of striking as a social practice in Canada, by providing an analytic framework for approaching the history of the right to strike, and then sketching the contours of that history. Focusing on the three key worker freedoms - to associate, to bargain collectively, and to strike - the authors trace the jural relations\nbetween workers, employers and the state through four successive regimes of industrial legality in Canada: master and servant; liberal voluntarism; industrial voluntarism; and industrial pluralism, the latter marked by the adoption of the Wagner Act model. On the basis of their review of those regimes, the authors argue that long before the modern\nscheme, workers enjoyed a virtually unlimited freedom to strike for collective bargaining purposes. Although government-imposed restrictions on the freedom have increased significantly, especially under industrial pluralism, legislatures have typically provided workers with compensating trade-offs, including rights enforceable against their employers. However, in contrast to the historical pattern, public-sector workers have with growing frequency been subjected to \"exceptionalism,\" i.e. the suspension or limitation of freedoms without a grant of compensatory rights. In the authors'view, it is the imposition of such measures that will likely provide the context for consideration of whether the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects the right to strike.",

        "abstractNote": "A relatively recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) publication is not the only voice that suggests the possibility of achieving prosperity and growth in the modern age without the need to have a strong manufacturing base. Like agriculture before the industrial revolution, \u201cmaking things\u201d appears to take the back seat as services, and in particular knowledge intensive services that determine \u201chow to make things\u201d, take over as growth drivers. Of course, the trends of progress are irreversible, and \u201cmaking things\u201d will constitute a shrinking part of employment and, possible value created. The latter will most likely be even truer if one cannot separate perfectly the value of incorporated services, as the knowledge content of the \u201cthings made\u201d and the incorporated services build their own complex interactions and grow exponentially. However, as we argue here, there will always be a need to make things (including the occasional spacesuit taking a drive in its interstellar Tesla car). Even as the relationship between physical manufacturing, knowledge and services becomes more blurred, manufacturing will remain an indispensable ingredient of the final product. As pointed out in the literature, the role of manufacturing is and will never be the same for developing and developed countries, performing different roles in both. For developing countries, it will still contribute towards the rapid development of key skills that will complete the skills set of the country, and for developed countries, it will have a mature and symbiotic relationship with services, ensuring the proximity of the know-how and the production of goods that incorporate it, seamless cooperation, and design and service development at the frontier.  --Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "This essay examines the United States Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 decision in Janus v AFSCME, Council 31, which concluded that agency shop provisions violate the First Amendment rights of public sector workers who are not union members but receive the fruits of the representation. This decision reversed over 40 years of precedent and imposed \u201cright to work\u201d as a new federal constitutional mandate, fulfilling the dream of anti-union forces since the first Gilded Age.\n\nThe essay begins with a brief history of the open shop movement and the development of the agency shop as a constitutionally permissible form of union security in the private and public sectors. It then describes how an activist Supreme Court majority undermined the constitutionality of the agency shop, which set the stage for the Janus decision. The essay summarizes the majority and dissenting opinions in Janus, and describes how unions, employers, and some state legislatures are responding to the decision\u2019s immediate impact.",

        "abstractNote": "An index-based approach to indicate the outcome of Occupational Health and Safety management has been commonly used in the implementation of the International Safety Management Code and the operation of Occupational Health and Safety management systems in the international shipping industry. Although the index-based approach is asserted to be a convenient way to measure and quantify the outcome of Occupational Health and Safety management, it is not justified in the wider literature and further empirical research is suggested by various authors. The aim of this study is to explore the role of an index-based approach in managing Occupational Health and Safety in the shipping industry.\n\nThis article investigates the effectiveness of indicators in Occupational Health and Safety management in two Chinese chemical shipping companies. A qualitative approach is applied to examine the views of seafarers on safety reporting practice. The study reveals that, although the need for reporting is understood by most of the crew members, the reporting practice is significantly affected by different factors such as the crew\u2019s concerns for their own interests, Chinese cultural factors and management\u2019s dominant power over the crew\u2019s performance evaluation. The findings suggest that there is a significant gap between what is required by the rules and what really occurs in terms of safety reporting practice. The study highlights the emerging problems of using Occupational Health and Safety indicators as benchmark for measuring the outcome of Occupational Health and Safety management in Chinese shipping. The conclusion is drawn in a Chinese context, and although the findings may not be similar to other industries or the shipping industry in other countries, they provide valuable indications for re-thinking and re-shaping maritime regulatory strategies.",

        "abstractNote": "Des travaux r\u00e9cents en analyse institutionnelle ont soulign\u00e9 le r\u00f4le charni\u00e8re des acteurs dans le changement institutionnel, notamment le pouvoir de l\u2019acteur syndical \u00e0 renouveler les institutions du travail. Ces recherches ont fait ressortir les trois aspects suivants : 1-l\u2019agentivit\u00e9, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question de larepr\u00e9sentation des syndiqu\u00e9s, notamment la construction d\u2019une identit\u00e9 des travailleurs au-del\u00e0 du milieu de travail; 2- la formation d\u2019une large coalition au-del\u00e0 des acteurs tripartites des relations de travail; et, enfin, 3-l\u2019\u00e9largissement des r\u00e9pertoires d\u2019action au-del\u00e0 des fronti\u00e8res des entreprises et des contextes nationaux. Toutefois, contrairement \u00e0 cette perspective sur l\u2019agentivit\u00e9 qui d\u00e9pendait autrefois des m\u00e9canismes de la d\u00e9mocratie industrielle, cet article montre que des contraintes structurelles peuvent restreindre, voire emp\u00eacher, la capacit\u00e9 strat\u00e9gique des acteurs locaux \u00e0 renouveler la r\u00e8gle en cet \u00e8re n\u00e9olib\u00e9ral de mondialisation de l\u2019\u00e9conomie.\n\u00c0 partir de deux \u00e9tudes de cas men\u00e9es dans deux usines de premi\u00e8re transformation au Qu\u00e9bec \u2014l\u2019une appartenant \u00e0 une entreprise multinationalecanadienne, l\u2019autre \u00e9tant am\u00e9ricaine \u2014, cet article analyse comment les acteurs locaux, dans un contexte n\u00e9olib\u00e9ral de changement institutionnel, n\u00e9gocient la flexibilisation de l\u2019emploi et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des travailleurs. Les r\u00e9sultats des n\u00e9gociations entreprises par les acteurs locaux, dans un cas, une n\u00e9gociation men\u00e9e \u00ab le dos au mur \u00bb, et, dans l\u2019autre, \u00ab le fusil sur la tempe \u00bb, montrent que l\u2019issue du processus est tributaire de facteurs externes hors de la port\u00e9e des acteurs locaux.\nL\u2019agentivit\u00e9 a but\u00e9 contre les imp\u00e9ratifs \u00e9conomiques du march\u00e9, les politiques \u00e9tatiques de d\u00e9r\u00e9gulation de l\u2019emploi et l\u2019intransigeance des maisons-m\u00e8res concernant l\u2019avantage comp\u00e9titif des filiales. Dans l\u2019usine am\u00e9ricaine, ils ont d\u00e9plac\u00e9 l\u2019ancienne r\u00e8gle des accords collectifs pour y substituer une nouvelle entente davantage ax\u00e9e sur les exigences du march\u00e9 lib\u00e9ral. Dans l\u2019usine canadienne, ils ont stratifi\u00e9 les accords collectifs, ajoutant une nouvelle entente (de facture inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne) bas\u00e9e sur le statut d\u2019emploi et qui oppose les permanents aux contractuels. Dans les deux cas, des conditions structurelles ont limit\u00e9 la marge de manoeuvre desacteurs locaux, avec des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9fastes sur les travailleurs p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques de l\u2019entreprise flexible.",

        "abstractNote": "Notre \u00e9tude cherche \u00e0 comprendre la militance dans de tr\u00e8s petites entreprises en France. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, nous cherchons \u00e0 cerner la forme prise par la militance dans ce contexte et les motivations du militant. Pour cela, nous nous appuyons sur 29 entretiens semi-directifs r\u00e9alis\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s de conseillers du salari\u00e9 des deux principales entit\u00e9s syndicales. Mobilisant la litt\u00e9rature sur l\u2019engagement et le travail militant, nous avons d\u00e9gag\u00e9 trois profils : le \u00ab bon soldat \u00bb, le \u00ab d\u00e9fenseur des droits \u00bb et le \u00ab combattant \u00bb.\n\nLe \u00ab bon soldat \u00bb a une strat\u00e9gie de valorisation de son syndicat. Sa militance s\u2019exprime par un accueil soign\u00e9 au salari\u00e9 et un alignement sur sa position dans sa relation avec l\u2019employeur. Son engagement militant montre qu\u2019il cherche \u00e0 pr\u00e9server un \u00e9quilibre entre son engagement syndical et sa vie priv\u00e9e. Le second profil, le \u00ab d\u00e9fenseur des droits \u00bb, est attir\u00e9 par les dimensions juridiques de son engagement aupr\u00e8s des salari\u00e9s. Le conseiller du salari\u00e9 ayant ce profil cherche \u00e0 construire une strat\u00e9gie de partenariat avec le salari\u00e9 afin d\u2019obtenir le moins de sanctions pour ce dernier. Pour lui, sa militance est d\u2019abord motiv\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense des droits du salari\u00e9. Le dernier profil, \u00ab le combattant \u00bb, est tr\u00e8s exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 syndicalement et il s\u2019int\u00e9resse davantage \u00e0 la relation interpersonnelle. Le conseiller du salari\u00e9 de ce profil met en place une strat\u00e9gie de conflits. Il s\u2019engage aupr\u00e8s du salari\u00e9 sans condition.

Une \u00e9tude de cas dans une administration ayant v\u00e9cu une r\u00e9organisation, confront\u00e9e \u00e0 la menace de l\u2019ouverture \u00e0 la concurrence et caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par un mod\u00e8le corporatiste, illustre ces points, tout en les accompagnant d\u2019un constat qui incite \u00e0 approfondir l\u2019analyse.\n\nEn effet, une premi\u00e8re analyse quantitative descriptive r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la charge de travail, et surtout le travail \u00ab inint\u00e9ressant \u00bb, vont croissant quand on s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve dans la hi\u00e9rarchie, ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui peut sembler \u00e0 prime abord \u00e9tonnant.

Ceux-ci peuvent \u00eatre li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture \u00e0 la concurrence, \u00e0 la mise en place d\u2019un syst\u00e8me de reddition de compte contraignant, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 des strat\u00e9gies mises en place par les diff\u00e9rents acteurs afin de g\u00e9rer leur travail en fonction des ressources \u00e0 leur disposition et de leur position dans le syst\u00e8me.\n\nUne typologie nous a conduite \u00e0 identifier quatre groupes de cadres caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s par des perceptions et des strat\u00e9gies homog\u00e8nes relatives \u00e0 la charge de travail.

        "abstractNote": "Research objective: Through relatively higher unionization rates within the casino industry, casino employment provides a counterexample to the connection between low-skill service work and low wages. The existing literature, however, suggests that casino workers embrace a commodified vision of their labour. It is of interest to understand whether and how unions are successful in decommodifying both ideologically and materially, wage entitlements in this expanding industry as this is a main mechanism through which unions challenge income inequality. This article examines the Canadian Auto Workers\u2019 (CAW) attempt to decommodify wages in the casino industry.\nMethodology: These findings are based on a case study of Casino Windsor, located in Windsor, Ontario\u2014the automotive capital of Canada and the first city to host a resort casino outside of Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Ninety-one interviews were conducted with Windsor stakeholders (20), and automotive (43) and casino (28) workers. The local newspaper from 1994-2014 is also examined and descriptive statistics are utilized.\nResults: Casino workers initially did adopt a decommodified vision of wage entitlements; yet, due to political\u2014the New Democratic Party of Ontario\u2014and institutional\u2014low sectoral union density\u2014forces, casino workers during 2014-2015 interviews embrace a service mind where wages are determined by a market-oriented human capital model.\nConclusions: CAW union representatives and the casino membership now view the CAW\u2019s attempt to bring an industrial mindset into the casino as a mistake, naturalizing the link between decommodified wages in automotive manufacturing and the market-oriented wage entitlements of the service sector. This case study marks a critical lost opportunity by the CAW to decommodify wage entitlements in the casino industry and the broader service sector.",

        "abstractNote": "The legalization of marijuana in Canada is expected to have a significant impact on workplaces, requiring the development or updating of company drug-related policies and procedures. To help employment relations stakeholders with this change, recommendations are made based on an analysis of 93 past arbitration/tribunal/court cases involving marijuana-related policy violations, drawn from the Labour Source database. Issues addressed include language and communication of the work rule, reasonableness of drug tests, standard of proof, duty to accommodate, and mitigating factors. Based on the study of those 93 court cases, some recommendations can be formulated. First, employers need to clearly state their drug-related policies, taking into consideration safety-sensitivity and any substance abuse culture. This may include prohibition of possession, use, and distribution of drugs at the workplace or working under the influence, and the need to report any medical drug use that requires accommodation. Drug tests should only be done when there is a bona fide occupational requirement or where safety is a concern, such as post-incident or when there is reasonable suspicion of drug impairment. Also, it is important to understand that positive drug test results can only show past drug use but not the level of impairment or whether the drug was used while on a work shift. Therefore, to support an offence violation and discipline, corroborating evidence from multiple witnesses and sources are often necessary. Supervisors should be trained to identify the characteristics related to marijuana and drug impairment and the procedures to follow when an incident occurs. Employers must be cognizant of the duty to accommodate medical marijuana users or recreational users who are addicted, under human rights protection for disability. Such accommodation may include work reassignment or a leave of absence. In deciding on a penalty, other than past performance and disciplinary records and personal extenuating circumstances, arbitrators may consider rehabilitation situations to assess the prognosis and viability of the employment relationship. Employers and unions are advised to stay abreast of latest developments in the laws, drug test technologies and medical research related to marijuana use.",

        "abstractNote": "We are honoured to take over as the editors of RI/IR. Our new responsibility, formally assumed in September 2018, weighs heavily on us. We know that the journal is special. Since 1945, it has carved out a reputation for being at the vanguard in presenting research concerning work, employment and the labour market, as well as for being transcendent in how it delivers its product. RI/IR distinguishes itself from its rivals in the way it brings together professionals from disparate cultural, linguistic and epistemological backgrounds. Much like Canada itself, the journal serves as a reminder that diversity is a strength and that respect for difference, far from being a matter of jaundiced tolerance, is in fact a critical precursor of greatness. Aside from its role as a broad church of ideas, methodologies and ideological orientations, RI/IR has provided a platform for francophone scholars to showcase their work alongside their Anglophone peers.  / Nous sommes honor\u00e9s d\u2019assumer le r\u00f4le de directeurs de la revue Relations industrielles/Industrial Relations (RI/IR) et nous mesurons pleinement l\u2019importance de cette nouvelle responsabilit\u00e9, dont nous sommes formellement investis depuis le mois de septembre 2018. Notre revue est particuli\u00e8re, nous le savons. Depuis 1945, elle s\u2019est forg\u00e9 une r\u00e9putation avant-gardiste gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la publication de travaux de recherche novateurs sur le travail, l\u2019emploi et le march\u00e9 du travail, tout en se surpassant dans sa fa\u00e7on de diffuser son produit. RI/IR se d\u00e9marque de ses concurrents par sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 rassembler des professionnels de diverses origines culturelles, linguistiques et \u00e9pist\u00e9mologiques. Tout comme le Canada, la revue rappelle, par son essence m\u00eame, que la diversit\u00e9 est une force et le respect de la diff\u00e9rence, loin d\u2019\u00eatre une tol\u00e9rance am\u00e8re, constitue un pr\u00e9curseur essentiel de la grandeur. Au-del\u00e0 de son r\u00f4le d\u2019incarner un large spectre d\u2019id\u00e9es, de m\u00e9thodologies et d\u2019orientations id\u00e9ologiques, RI/IR offre aux chercheurs francophones une plateforme qui leur permet de pr\u00e9senter leurs travaux \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de leurs homologues anglophones. --Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "This trailblazing history of early British Columbia focuses on a single year, 1858, the year of the Fraser River gold rush \u2014 the third great mass migration of gold seekers after the Californian and Australian rushes in search of a new El Dorado. Marshall\u2019s history becomes an adventure, prospecting the rich pay streaks of British Columbia\u2019s \u201cfounding\u201d event and the gold fever that gripped populations all along the Pacific Slope. Marshall unsettles many of our most taken-for-granted assumptions: he shows how foreign miner-militias crossed the 49th parallel, taking the law into their own hands, and conducting extermination campaigns against Indigenous peoples while forcibly claiming the land. Drawing on new evidence, Marshall explores the three principal cultures of the goldfields \u2014 those of the fur trade (both Native and the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company), Californian, and British world views. The year 1858 was a year of chaos unlike any other in British Columbia and American Pacific Northwest history. It produced not only violence but the formal inauguration of colonialism, Native reserves and, ultimately, the expansion of Canada to the Pacific Slope. Among the haunting legacies of this rush are the cryptic place names that remain \u2014 such as American Creek, Texas Bar, Boston Bar, and New York Bar \u2014 while the unresolved question of Indigenous sovereignty continues to claim the land. -- Publisher's website description",

At the tender age of eight, Lynn Jones began cutting out articles from the Truro newspaper, preserving stories pertaining to Black life in Nova Scotia and around the world. One of ten children, Lynn kept busy documenting the many activities of generations of the Jones family, from those who fought with the Black Battalion in World War I to those active today. Along the way, she added numerous documents \u2013 many of them not found elsewhere \u2013 and correspondence related to organizations such as the Black Working Group and the Public Service Alliance of Canada (psac) and individuals like Kwame Ture (Stokely Carmichael). The result is eighteen boxes, with talk of more to come. While the collection stretches from the 1960s to the 2010s, the bulk of material pertains to the 1980s and 1990s. -- Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "At the current conjuncture, histories of Canadian Communism seem analytically stalled in a fruitless (if inadequately addressed) historiographic impasse, ordered by oppositions: Moscow domination vs. local autonomy; authoritarianism vs. the pursuit of social justice. We need to confront these experiences, not as dichotomies, but as related phenomena, developing our histories of Communism around more totalizing appreciations that encompass both sides of a seemingly divided logic of classification. Having myself tried to see beyond the limiting oppositions of the extant historiography, I will explore how certain historians seem unwilling to look past the conveniently counter-posed analyses of two existing schools of thought, labelled traditionalists/revisionists in the United States and essentialists/realists in the United Kingdom. As distortions of my own writing suggest, we have reached a point where it is both appropriate and necessary to be more rigorous and fair-minded in our characterization of the historiography.  --Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "The labour movement's inability to effectively respond to neoliberalism has resulted in reduced union membership and declining public status and influence of labour unions. This is having a cascading effect on other institutions that are at least peripherally linked with the working class, from the rightward march of social democratic parties to the move away from class as the foundation of labour history. I suggest that the absence of revolutionary unions, those fighting for a future beyond capitalism, is one of the key underlying causes of labour's current malaise. By revolutionary unions, I mean unions that are explicitly pro-socialist and anti-capitalist in intent and that, by their actions and by the response of capital and state to those actions, foster an awareness of the class nature of society, the specific interests of working people as a class, and possibilities for collectively pursuing a better future. --Introduction",

This article argues that one possible way out of this impasse lies in foregrounding the particular relationship between colonial exploitation and class exploitation in our settler colonial economy, both in terms of class formation and in the ongoing project of social reproduction. The adoption of a \"settler order framework\" seeks to build on important recent works attempting to understand Indigenous peoples' participation in the ranks of those who toil, struggle, and dream of freedom from capitalism, by integrating the fundamental reality of settler workers' ongoing theft of Indigenous land and resources into the story of the Canadian working class.",

        "abstractNote": "The 21st century has seen growing attention to settler colonialism among academic researchers in Canada and internationally. In the Canadian context, interest has been fuelled above all by an ongoing resurgence of Indigenous activism and intellectual work, of which the most visible expression to most non-Indigenous people was the Idle No More movement of 2012\u201313. To date, however, little attention has been paid to settler colonialism within labour studies, broadly understood. As a modest contribution to remedying this deficiency, this article argues for the importance of understanding Canada as a settler-colonial society, proposes a conceptualization of settler colonialism from the perspective of a historical materialism reconstructed through engagement with Indigenous anticolonial thought, and offers some preliminary reflections on integrating analysis of settler colonialism into historical and contemporary research on labour.",

Ses caract\u00e9ristiques sont cependant diff\u00e9rentes de celles du travail ouvrier.

        "abstractNote": "My research explores the labour conditions experienced by foreign nurses employed in health care in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada, on temporary permits. I draw on ethnographic interviews to understand the nuanced ways in which foreign nurses feel welcomed in their local communities and work-places, yet simultaneously remain subject to hostile racialized scrutiny. Nova Scotia is one of the least ethnically diverse provinces in Canada and one of the most economically impoverished. It faces a shortage of healthcare workers, exacerbated by the ongoing restructuring of the healthcare sector. These contextual factors contribute to the complicated push-pull matrix discussed by the temporary foreign nurses, who feel needed, but not wanted. This matrix cannot be dismissed as simply the racism and \"backwardness\" of local communities. Rather, it must be understood through a political economy focus on temporary foreign workers, restructured health care, and the normalization of a precarious labour landscape in which racialized foreign and local workers are pitted against each other.",

The strict hierarchy that constituted the communist movement in the 1930s was not yet extant, and the realm of possibilities was limited only by the imagination of the organization itself. The material produced in this period was neither crass agitprop nor cheap melodrama. Rather, it was bottom-up expressions of proletarian high culture and organic reflections of the social, economic, and political realities that constituted the experiences of Ukrainian progressives in Canada. As such, in the 1920s, the theatre served as the movement's most effective vehicle for political propaganda and ethnocultural instruction.",

During World War II, the state, together with its munitions-industry allies, broadly considered workers\u2019 nutritional health as a critical component to achieving maximum wartime industrial production. Following the war, both the state and industry imagined the nutritional health of workers\u2019 bodies as crucial to Canada\u2019s postwar prosperity. Facilitating as well as frustrating these largely state-directed nutrition agendas was a combination of medico-scientific knowledge, the sometimes uncertain and unpredictable participation of both employers and workers, and wider national and international historical contexts.",

        "abstractNote": "For decades Canadian trade unionists have expressed frustration with the grievance arbitration system, but this tends to be limited to criticisms of the legalistic nature of the process and the costs and delays involved in getting a judgement. There is little discussion or debate about the denial of the right to strike, which is the central feature of the system. Nor is there much discussion about approaches to contract enforcement that situate legal strategies in broader political strategies to use worker power effectively, including the withdrawal of labour. This study investigates how the United Electrical Workers (ue), a left-led union, defended workers' rights at Canadian General Electric (cge) and Westinghouse in the early years of the new legal regime. pecifically, it charts the North American origins of grievance arbitration systems, sketches the development of personnel policies in the electrical industry, surveys the ue Canadian district's struggle to establish contractual relations and codify workplace rights at these two corporations, reconstructs the elements of ue's approach to contract enforcement, and reviews a number of mid-contract work stoppages at cge and Westinghouse between 1946 and 1966 to determine how the union, workers, employers, and arbitrators negotiated the ban on grievance strikes as they adjusted to new legislation and new collective agreement language.",

        "abstractNote": "This article explores how women forest workers\u2019 perceptions of restructuring are related to their work identities. Drawing on semi\u2010structured interviews with 29 women working in subsidiaries of a multinational forest company in northern Saskatchewan, I describe how women workers selectively drew on traditional mill worker and flexible worker identities to legitimize and delegitimize restructuring. Women's understandings of themselves as workers were shaped by their paradoxical relationships to standard forest processing work. Some women with previous experience working in low\u2010waged service industries adopted worker subjectivities that legitimized restructuring and valued flexibility, individual empowerment, and mobility. Other women delegitimized restructuring, referencing traditional characterizations of forest work that valued community stability, collective resistance, and security. Many women, however, neither consistently legitimized nor delegitimized restructuring throughout their interviews. This last group's ambiguous portrayal of work and restructuring demonstrates the identity dilemmas faced by new entrants to declining industrial sectors. Restructuring interrupted women's narratives of having found a \u201cgood job\u201d in forestry and prompted the renegotiation of their understandings of mill work. This article contributes to our understanding of restructuring in resource industries by drawing attention to how worker identities, gender, and industrial change are interrelated.",

There, they gather again at the mine-head, waiting for word on the men trapped underground, as their fear and rage builds. When the husband of one of the women is badly injured, their desire to help her quickly leads them into a much larger campaign to help all the families they can. Before long, they've become the heart and soul of a large-scale union-organizing drive that is fuelled by their sheer will--and sometimes giddy enthusiasm--but that is also put to the test by their own inexperience, a bitter strike, and the brutal force of the powers that be. --Publisher's description",

Sid Ryan, one of Canada's most courageous and progressive union leaders, draws on the experience of his varied and colourful life to show what is right with the labour movement, what is wrong, and what has to change if it is to avoid becoming irrelevant. He calls for the adoption of Social Movement Unionism, in which labour forges an alliance with other progressive elements in civil society, taking up the cause of young people, precarious workers, and immigrants. He demands a renewed commitment to the NDP, the party that was built by unions, and he argues that the Leap Manifesto should become the pillars of the movement in Canada.  --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "Conversations around a kitchen table are a common experience, but playwright Rick Duthie believes that in Sudbury, something has been missing from the discussion. Duthie\u2019s new play, One Day Stronger, explores Sudbury\u2019s labour history from the perspective of Laurie, anchored to her kitchen table, who relives her childhood memories from the 1958 Inco strike to her present, at the end of the 1978 Inco strike. With more than 20,000 people on strike in a city of just 75,000, the post-war Inco strikes were a time of tension, disunity, and emotional exhaustion. Duthie\u2019s play explores these events from the intimate perspective of a family, and a girl at two different points in her life.  --Introduction",

We were attracted to the idea of examining life in such a town from World War II into the new millennium as seen through the eyes of a haiku poet. The diverse cultural mix of the miners themselves further enhances the breccia theme. The earliest miners were, primarily, a m\u00e9lange of European immigrants who relocated to find a better life. This potpourri was enriched by large numbers of immigrants and displaced persons fleeing a war-ravaged Europe. The result was a northern Ontario mining culture with a distinctly varied foundation. --From authors' introduction.\nSix haiku by Ignatius Fay:  headlamps off / inky black and the sounds / of shifting rock -- dad's St. Christopher / black with sweat / and mine dust -- two p.m. / the school shudders / with the mine's daily blast -- moving day / his father's job lost / to a Scooptram -- retired from mining / the school janitor's limp / worse in autumn -- played-out mine site - / the green of young thistles / in rust-stained soil.

        "abstractNote": "This May, Canada marks the 100th anniversary of the Winnipeg General Strike, when tens of thousands of people walked off their jobs in sympathy and solidarity with building and metal trades workers whose employers were refusing to bargain for fair wages and working conditions.Though the strike failed in its immediate goals, the example it set reverberated across the country and the world, inspiring political upheaval at all levels in Canada, and ultimately transforming the balance of power between workers and the bosses for many generations.\n\nIn this issue of the Monitor we consider the value of direct action and solidarity strikes in a new era of retrenching labour rights, out-of-control inequality and conservative backlash. \u201cWorkers can make great gains by withdrawing their labour power. But they also risk a lot,\u201d writes the Graphic History Collective in their introduction to our special feature on the strike. \u201cThe stakes in class struggle are high.\u201d True. But so are the costs of not acting. Today, as it was 100 years ago, we must continually fight for fair pay and good jobs for everyone\u2014or be prepared to live in a world where neither exists for anyone.  --Introduction",

        "abstractNote": "The article focuses on the changing workforce in Canada and corporations employing minorities and aboriginal peoples. Sabir Mohamed knows how difficult it can be starting out in a new country. Originally from India, he immigrated to Canada in 2001. But his engineering degree, his MBA and his 12 years' experience in four industries in five countries were not enough--or maybe too much--for Canadian recruiters. The Specialized Packaging Group Inc., a major player among North American producers of paperboard cartons, hired him at its London, Ont., plant. Mohamed and some four million other visible minorities are important players in Canada's workforce. Typically better educated than other Canadians, according to the Toronto-based Canadian Race Relations Foundation, they make up almost 13% of labour-market availability. In Canada, the federal Employment Equity Act is intended to remove the \"barriers\" faced by four designated groups--women, the disabled, visible minorities and Aboriginal Peoples. The legislation applies only to federally regulated companies and those doing business with the government under the Federal Contractors Program--about 1,425 organizations. Yet despite such initiatives and our multicultural makeup, workplace diversity is just not something that some Canadians are particularly comfortable discussing. That was certainly what Canadian Business discovered when--in partnership with multicultural broadcaster OMNI Television, also owned by Rogers Communications--we undertook a groundbreaking assessment of how visible minorities and Aboriginal Peoples are faring in corporate Canada. Still, many companies are studying the composition of their workforce. Why? Because diversity, they say, makes good business sense--and without measuring, it's impossible to know where you're at.",

They demanded higher pay, better working conditions and the right to bargain collectively. Some 35,000 workers took over the running of Canada's third-largest city for six weeks.\n\nThe Winnipeg General Strike was one of the most important labour events in Canadian history. It began months after the end of the Great War, which had demanded profound sacrifices. Husbands, sons and siblings died; soldiers returned from the front with profound physical and psychological scars. Back at home, unemployment and inflation were rampant.  \"The whole world was in ferment,\" said Ian McKay, L.R. Wilson Chair in Canadian History at McMaster University and the author of Reasoning Otherwise, Leftists and the Peoples Enlightenment in Canada, 1890 to 1920. \"It was a very exciting but worrying time to be alive. The fall of the Czar was pivotal.\" --Introduction",

Using more than eighty interviews with women who lived and worked in Toronto in the 1930s, Breadwinning Daughters examines the consequences of these years for women in their homes and workplaces, and in the city's court rooms and dance halls.\n\nIn this insightful account, Katrina Srigley argues that young women were central to the labour market and family economies of Depression-era Toronto. Oral histories give voice to women from a range of cultural and economic backgrounds, and challenge readers to consider how factors such as race, gender, class, and marital status shaped women's lives and influenced their job options, family arrangements, and leisure activities. Breadwinning Daughters brings to light previously forgotten and unstudied experiences and illustrates how women found various ways to negotiate the burdens and joys of the 1930s. --Publisher's description",

        "abstractNote": "\"In the standard histories of the Grand Trunk, the episode [strike] is hurriedly misinterpreted as a company triumph. Yet Canada's first national railway strike merits a centennial recognition both as an epic struggle and because of its consequences. The incredible victory of the Brotherhood not only entrenched the union in Canada but confirmed one of the first formal collective agreements to be negotiated between a major Canadian corporation and its employees. As a precedent for the national custom of legislating inconvenient strikes out of existence, the Breaches of Contract Act should rival the better-known Trade Unions Act of 1872 as a landmark statute. The most fascinating feature of the strike \u2014 its success in a period of almost unbroken labour setbacks \u2014 allows a glimpse at the strange coalition of allies the engineers could assemble when they took on the Grand Trunk.\" --From author's introduction",

Yet the government failed to suppress labour unrest and to prevent successful strike action. Many officials and contractors accepted this failure as proof of the Celt's ungovernable disposition. Invoking the Irish stereotype to explain the disorder along the canals, they ignored their own role in promoting unrest and obscured the class dimension of the canallers' behaviour. They also misinterpreted the nature of the relationship between the canallers' ethno-culture and their collective action. What the southern Irish brought to the new world was not a propensity for violence and rioting, but a culture shaped by class relations in the old world. Class tensions, inseparably interwoven with racial hatred and discrimination, had created in the southern Irish suspicion and hatred of employers, distrust of the laws and the authorities, and a willingness to violate the law to achieve their ends. This bitter cultural legacy shaped the Irish labourers' resistance to conditions in the Canadas and gave a distinctive form to class conflict on the canals.\" --Author's conclusion.",

        "abstractNote": "Between 1916 and 1922 workers in the United States participated in the longest and most intensive strike wave in the country's history. Four characteristics of the epoch's strikes help us understand the interaction between an emerging collectivist style of capitalism and workers' use of the strike weapon. First, individual strikes frequently closed an industry across the nation, or else precipitated city-wide sympathetic strikes. Second, an aspiration for industrial unionism was evident in both official collaboration among craft unions and all-grades action by workers undertaken in defiance of their unions. Third, much of the strike activity was informed by a One Big Union myth, despite the lack of influence of either the IWW or the OBU. Fourth, immigrants were especially prominent among the strikers. The attraction of notions of \"workers' control\" to older immigrants and the power of nationalism among all immigrants shaped the goals and structures of unions and of strikers. Although no united working-class movement could congeal, let alone prevail, under these circumstances, a significant minority of highly politicized workers remained to make its presence felt in urban life after the strike wave had subsided.",

Despite much initial success, the Lumber Workers Industrial Union was moribund by 1922, and it soon disappeared completely from provincial logging camps. As well as examining the grievances of the loggers, the changing nature of the logging industry, and the actions of employers, this history of the LWIU also offers insights into the character of the Canadian working class in the post-War years by highlighting the struggles of the Socialist Party of Canada, the One Big Union, and the Industrial Workers of the World to dominate the LWIU. Furthermore, this article draws Out and assesses the divergent programmes of the LWIU leaders, who were aligned with the Socialist Party of Canada, and the men in the camps, exposing a fundamental gap in the post-War socialist agenda.",

En premier lieu, il pr\u00e9sente les incidences qu'a eu la r\u00e9volution administrative sur l'organisation du travail bancaire et surtout sur la r\u00e9partition sexuelle des t\u00e2ches. Tandis que les hommes sont pr\u00e9sents dans l'ensemble des groupes d'emplois, les femmes occupent un \u00e9ventail plus restreint de postes. Bien des \u00e9tudes jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour en ont conclu que les femmes n'auraient eu d'autres possibilit\u00e9s que d'occuper les emplois subalternes et mal r\u00e9tribu\u00e9s, laissant aux employ\u00e9s masculins les postes qualifi\u00e9s. Ce type de conclusions pose de nombreaux probl\u00e8mes dans la mesure o\u00f9 il pr\u00e9sente la main-d'oeuvre f\u00e9minine comme \u00e9tant un groupe homog\u00e8ne et masque la diversit\u00e9 des exp\u00e9riences professionnelles f\u00e9minines. L'analyse comparative des intin\u00e9raires individuels au sein de la banque, plut\u00f4t que l'\u00e9tude plus conventionnelle de la seule organisation du travail, permet de faire \u00e9merger cette diversit\u00e9 des exp\u00e9riences et des pratiques professionnelles et ce, tant chez les femmes que chez les hommes.",

However, interview data show that both middle- and working-class Canadian children continued to do a great deal of work in their households. Many young boys and girls also worked at regular and irregular part-time paying jobs. The earnings of working-class children often stood between their families and real economic hardship, while those of middle-class youngsters reduced pressure on tight family budgets. In addition to its contribution to family economies, children's work played a considerable role in developing the gender identities of both girls and boys.",

Undoubtedly the city's most important union the LSPU organized all waterfront workers in the city, including the numerous boys who worked on the docks, and later extended the organization to include the city's sanitation workers. Through militancy and frequent strikes the LSPU established a permanent presence in St John's. The success of the LSPU is contrasted with the experience of longshoremen in Atlantic Canadian ports to raise questions about earlier interpretations of class solidarity within merchant capital.",

        "abstractNote": "The Dominion of Newfoundland gave up responsible government in 1934. From then until 1949, when it joined Canada, Newfoundland was governed by a Commission responsible to the British government in Westminster. The ostensible cause of the collapse of democratic government in Newfoundland was a financial crisis and the country's impending bankruptcy triggered by a drastic fall in state revenue during the depression of the early 1930s. The financial side of the crisis. Newfoundland's economic weakness, and the broad political events of the period have received considerable attention. But aspects of Newfoundland's internal politics have not received the attention they deserve. It has been noted that there was little opposition to the movement in favour of an end to democratic government developed in Newfoundland in the early 1930s. It is aspects of this movement that are examined in this paper. Why did people in Newfoundland not only accept, but in many cases openly work for, and end to responsible government? In trying to answer this question attention is focused on the actions of labour leaders and the political representatives of the working classes. In particular, the disillusion with democracy of two key reformers, J.R. Smallwood, the founder of the first Newfoundland Federation of Labour, and William Coaker, the founder of the Fishermen's Protective Union, is explored.",

In the Conception Bay outports of Harbour Grace and Carbonear the social divisions and alliances which spawned an active culture of resistance formed around ethno-religious groups, political affiliation, and social class. The first part of this paper will recount a number of diverse collective plebeian acts and look at the natives and loyalties connected with each. Part two deals with election violence with which the population used informal means to affect change in a formal theatre. Section three is devoted to the largest plebeian disturbance of the decade; the 1832 sealers' strike. Here fishermen overcame their various social biases to work in class ways for their common good.",

By taking advantage of changes in the fishery, more prosperous fishermen began to deal with other firms, undercutting Baine, Johnston's domination of Battle Harbour. As Baine, Johnston withdrew winter credit, poorer fishermen threatened the firm with direct, violent action which neither the merchant nor the state were able to deal with except by granting relief. Such actions by Battle Harbour fishermen indicate that they were able to step outside the supposed limits of the culture of their kin-based villages, and confront directly the exploitation of merchant capital in the cod fishery.",

        "abstractNote": "As the Canadian and international record will testify, the years between 1917-1920 were critically important to workers' aspirations for industrial unionism. An account of the Newfoundland Industrial Workers' Association (NIWA) has largely been passed over in the writing of the Island's labour history. Yet this organization figures prominently in the events which helped to shape the labour-capital relationship during the wartime period. In the Newfoundland context, the effective use of the strike weapon during this period is a telling indicator of the heightened sense of militancy resulting from the temporary convergence of labour organizations around issues relating to the war. Centred in St. John's. but exerting an Island-wide presence, the NIWA arose Out of a pressing need for Newfoundlanders to address the economic and political exigencies of World War I. This article examines the NIWA in terms of its structure, membership, and mandate for change with specific reference to the major confrontation waged between the NIWA and their principal opponent, the Reid Newfoundland Company in the spring of 1918.",

        "abstractNote": "The resignation of J.B. McClachlan from the Communist Party of Canada in 1936 is one of the more controversial episodes in the biography of a well-known Canadian labour radical. He was one of the few party leaders to enjoy wide recognition and popular support. His resignation was a difficult personal decision as well as a significant episode in the history of the party. In previous accounts his resignation has been presented ultimately as a repudiation of labour radicalism generally and the Communist Party in particular, as a protest against the adoption of the united front in 1935, or as a form of local and personal political exceptionalism. McLachlan himself made no formal public announcement of his resignation and, except for an impromptu speech at a public meeting in September 1936, he remained largely silent. In response to a letter from party general secretary Tim Buck he prepared a personal explanation of his withdrawal from the party in June 1936. This document, which is reproduced at the end of this article, remains the most important single piece of evidence concerning his resignation. An analysis of the circumstances leading to McLachlan's resignation shows that he did not regard his resignation as a repudiation of basic principles. He had supported the move towards the united front both internationally and domestically but disagreed with the implementation of the policy by the party leadership, especially sa demonstrated in the case of the Amalgamated Mine Workers of Nova Scotia. McLachlan's view of the united front, which he considered to be consistent with the position of the Communist International, stressed the principles of internal democracy and local autonomy in the construction of the united front. In McLachlan's view there were already enough indications to show that leaders such as John L. Lewis had not been fundamentally transformed and that in the long run the decision to endorse an alliance of convenience with the established labour bureaucracy was an ambiguous legacy for the class struggle. In 1936 McLachlan was overtaken by events, but given his own history he was in a position to perceive the difficulties ahead more clearly than most of his contemporaries.",

A prominent trade union leader and revolutionary propagandist in Vancouver, he was a founding member of the Communist Party of Canada in 1921 and its first provincial chairman in British Columbia. At the level of leadership, however, the foundation period of the communist movement in Vancouver was dominated by recurring disputes between Kavanagh and the party centre in Toronto, suggesting a kind of regional factionalism. This article reviews that historical experience and assesses Kavanagh's place in Canada's radical heritage.",

The life of Bill Pritchard reveals the humanist roots of the SPC and what the party's leading thinkers owed to William Morris and the British ethical socialist tradition. That tradition was about `making socialists' who were educated, organized, and prepared to implement fully a socialist society. Bill Pritchard and other Marxian socialists, as much as they supported the Russian Revolution, were unwilling to submerge that goal in the program of the Third International. Their humanism, as much as their determinism, explains the choices they made and the legacy they left.",

It represents teaching as a contractory endeavour organized around the reproduction of labour power. Drawing upon secondary accounts of teaching and state formation (supplemented with representative documents from the period of concern), the article emphasizes how struggles between different segments of the teaching force and state representatives emerged around changing moral and technical priorities. In the context of state formation and subsequent industrial development, teaching was transformed by the end of the 19th century from a relatively autonomous occupation to a highly regulated and segmented force of dependent state employees.",

The ITU and IPP&AU organized along masculine craft lines and effectively defended their status within the workplace with industrial capitalist incursions and the mechanization of the production process. A crisis to male domination of typesetting occurred with the introduction of machine typesetting in newspaper production during the early 1890s. The ITU succeeded in securing control over the operations of the machines for its predominately male membership. By the mid-19th century the work of press feeder was defined as unskilled work suitable for women and boys. With the introduction of larger and faster presses during the last two decades of the 19th century, the IPP&AU struggled to appropriate the task for masculinity using the male breadwinner ideal. The IBB actively supported the organization of women bindery workers from its inception in 1892, albeit with the intent of protecting the interests of journeymen.",

        "abstractNote": "The recent historiography pertaining to women during World War II has tended to focus on women in either the war industries or armed forces. While the first feminist scholars argued that women experienced a type of second emancipation during this period due to changes in societal attitudes, more recently, historians have contended that women were temporarily treated to certain economic and social benefits during the War because the government and industries were in desperate need of workers. This paper attempts to offer an alternative interpretation of women's experiences during this time, through the investigation of female textile workers in Cornwall, Ontario. Using a dual structural analysis, this study illustrates how male union leaders and company owners often collaborated in maintaining a segregated work force. Instead of experiencing a type of liberation from traditional occupational constraints, Cornwall's female textile workers remained subjugated in lower paying and lower skilled \"female\" jobs in the mills. Within this industry then, continuity rather than change characterized the experiences of female textile workers during World War II.",

It rejects the proposition that ethnic tensions were a major factor, arguing instead that Morrison conforms to Eric Hobsbawm's definition of a primitive rebel. With the railway undermining the local subsistence-oriented economy and encouraging families to migrate from the district, the Highland community was facing a survival crisis which it would ultimately lose. The Megantic Outlaw affair therefore represented a final defiant and largely symbolic stand on the part of a tightly-knit rural community succumbing to the forces of industrial capitalism.",

One of these settlements, on Burrard Inlet, is best understood as the operation of industrial capitalism in a frontier setting. While settlement clustered around two sawmills, the power of capital -- expressed through policies of managerial paternalism -- was sharply curtailed by the ethnically complex, relatively transient, geographically isolated, and generally unstable nature of lumber society. As a consequence, relations between the companies and the community were much more a negotiated process than a simple exercise of managerial domination. Lumber capitalists could not escape the constraints imposed upon them by the frontier nature of their operation.",

        "abstractNote": "Most Canadian prisoners work, yet very little attention has been paid to them as workers by either labour scholars or unions. However, in 1977 the Canadian Food and Allied Workers union (CFAW) organized both incarcerated and non-incarcerated meat cutters into the country's first and only legally recognized union representing primarily prisoners, CFAW Local 240. The union drive came in response to the Ontario government's push to increase prisoners' participation in the workforce, including the introduction of a number of \"outside managed industrial programs\", which involved private firms operating within provincial correctional facilities. These privately managed industries rekindled some older debates around the potential for prison labour to undermine the wages of free labour, but in the case of the experimental abattoir program at Guelph, they also resulted in something new: unionized prisoners. The union not only made important gains for the workers, but also made modest gains for prisoners' rights. While CFAW Local 240 would eventually be merged into subsequent unions, it continues to serve as a model for working prisoners and represents a rare moment in Canadian history - one where a union organized prison labour instead of opposing it.",

En 1833, peu avant que ne d\u00e9bute la saison de la construction, les compagnons charpentiers-menuisiers de Montr\u00e9al annoncent qu\u2019ils ne travailleront plus au-del\u00e0 de dix heures par jour, faute de quoi ils recourront \u00e0 la gr\u00e8ve. \u00c0 la suite d\u2019une victoire partielle aupr\u00e8s des employeurs, le mouvement reprend de plus belle en 1834 et s\u2019\u00e9tend m\u00eame aux ma\u00e7ons, aux cordonniers, aux tailleurs et aux boulangers de Montr\u00e9al. Une alliance de plusieurs ma\u00eetres fera toutefois \u00e9chouer ce mouvement pour la journ\u00e9e de dix heures, d\u00e8s le mois de mai 1834. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tendait jadis Catherine Vance dans un article de la revue The Marxist Quarterly, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en 1962, nous croyons que l\u2019enjeu de la gr\u00e8ve des charpentiers-menuisiers d\u00e9passait la seule r\u00e9clamation de la journ\u00e9e de dix heures.

        "abstractNote": "The Gouzenko Affair is referred to as the event that started the Cold War. This article draws on recently declassified documents that shed new light on Britain's role in this affair, particularly that of the Foreign Office and the British High Commissioner to Canada. The documents reveal how the British had a major part in directing the response to Igor Gouzenko's defection in 1945. This event revealed the need for increased counterespionage security, but it also became a spectacle that directed the public's attention away from the British connection: specifically, the role of Alan Nunn May, a British nuclear scientist who had provided the Soviets with classified information. Instead, the public's interest was centred on Soviet spies, communism as a subversive force, and the brewing Soviet-US conflict. These newly declassified sources demonstrate how it was the British intelligence services and the British government that went to great lengths to help focus the public's attention in this direction. They took great pains to direct Canadian policymaking, which included working to discourage Canada's prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King from handling the affair privately with the Soviet ambassador, and were likely behind the infamous press leak to US reporter Drew Pearson that forced King to call a Royal Commission and publicize the affair. With the help of the British government and intelligence services, the Cold War began.",

In response to growing labour unrest in the public sector, the Lougheed government created a joint government/union task force with the csa of a on 11 February 1975 to review the legislation governing provincial employees and to recommend changes in legislation necessary to achieve a better system of labour relations. The creation of the task force created a period of labour peace in the provincial public sector leading up to the provincial election in the spring of 1975. However, following the re-election of the Lougheed government, public sector labour legislation was revised with the passage of the highly anti-union Public Service Employee Relations Act in May 1977.\nInternal government documents of the day suggest the task force process was a cynical manipulation of the union in an effort to defuse public employee militancy and to delay conflict.",

        "abstractNote": "Canada\u2019s system of industrial legality has routinely limited the collective abilities of workers to strike. Under the conditions of neoliberal globalization, those limitations have intensified. Yet, in 1997, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, waged a successful strike against Pepsi-Cola Canada. In addition to defeating the company, the union also expanded workers\u2019 collective rights through a successful constitutional challenge to restrictive common-law rules limiting secondary picketing. This paper examines the history of that strike, exploring the multifaceted strategies that the workers undertook to challenge the company, the state, and the existing law. It argues that workers were successful because they utilized tactics of civil disobedience to defend their abilities to picket. Recognizing that success, the paper is also critical of the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision and its evolution of common-law torts to limit workers\u2019 collective action. The paper concludes by arguing that the Pepsi conflict highlights the importance of civil disobedience in building workers\u2019 movements while emphasizing the inherent limitations of constitutional challenges to further workers\u2019 collective freedoms in Canada.",

Since its founding in 1980, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) has become the key labour-supported \u201cthink tank\u201d of the left in Canada, contributing to the process of social democratization by acting as a collective organic intellectual for a wide range of oppositional groups and networks that, we suggest, make up a social democratic community of practice. The CCPA has developed a number of strategies aimed at democratizing knowledge production, perhaps unique in the context of Canadian policy groups. Nonetheless, it faces a number of challenges in following through with these strategies and potential paradoxes in simultaneously engaging both the mainstream (general public and policymakers) and the various counterpublics that make up its community of practice.",

One of the enduring legacies of the \u201ccanoe boom\u201d was the American Canoe Association (ACA), a transnational organization established in 1880 to \u201cunite all amateur canoeists for the purpose of pleasure, health, or exploration.\u201d Annual meet\u00adings were central to realizing this mission. For two weeks in August, hundreds of enthusiasts from Canada and the United States came together to camp out, socialize, and race canoes. The encampments would not have occurred \u2013 or at the very least they would have looked drastically different \u2013 without the carpenters, cooks, servers, performers, and general labourers the organization hired to do the heavy work of construction, maintenance, and service. In spite of their importance, these workers exist, at best, on the margins of the official accounts of the meets; in most cases, they are altogether ignored. Recovery of this labouring past is difficult, and admittedly fragmentary. However, it is critical to the history of labour and of sport.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines some of Depression-era Canada\u2019s most influential labour newspapers with the intent to show that their writers were deeply inspired by radical Christianity. While connected in many ways to earlier strands of working-class and leftist Christianity as typified by the social gospel, radical Christianity differs in the extent to which the roots of social dysfunction were acknowledged as being linked to the capitalist order, and the solution being in its destruction. In this way, one can find deep intellec\u00adtual connections between the Canadian labour press and the members of the Fellowship of a Christian Social Order (FCSO). Thus, this article not only examines labour intellectuals in a Gramscian light, but seeks to challenge the claim among many historians that links between labour and Christianity col\u00adlapsed before the Depression. Indeed, labour intellectuals sought to confront the prevailing hegemony of a capitalistic Christianity, not only by challeng\u00ading the links the institutional churches held with the economic elite but also through developing understanding of how capitalism played an intrinsic role in the creation of sin and suffering.",

        "abstractNote": "In this article, I examine the Service, Office, and Retail Workers\u2019 Union of Canada (SORWUC), an independent, grassroots, socialist-feminist union that organized workers in unorganized industries in Canada in the 1970s and 1980s. I look at SORWUC\u2019s role in Canadian labour history in general, and its efforts to organize workers in the service industry in particular. My central thesis is that SORWUC\u2019s socialist-feminist unionism and commitment to organizing unorganized workers positioned the union as radically differ\u00adent from the mainstream labour movement. This difference both helped and hindered the union. Specifically, SORWUC\u2019s experiences organizing workers at Bimini pub and Muckamuck restaurant in British Columbia demonstrate that although its alternative structure and strategies aided organizing and strike efforts, these factors made little difference in the union\u2019s dealings with the labour relations boards and the courts: in both cases, the action or inaction of the state ultimately determined the outcome. Although SORWUC no longer exists, it remains an important historical example of how workers in Canada have been and can be organized. SORWUC thus offers important lessons about service worker organizing, alternative forms of unionization, and the powerful role of the state in labour relations in the postwar period.",

        "abstractNote": "Access to labour relations legislation is generally seen as a prerequisite to unionization of agricultural workers in Canada. British Columbia is one of eight Canadian provinces that now include agricultural workers in provincial labour relations legislation. But agricultural workers were not always included. Although union organizing and strike activity were not unheard of in BC\u2019s agricultural sector in the 1930s, the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1937 excluded agricultural workers. This exclusion followed a larger pattern of excluding agricultural workers from employment-related legisla\u00adtion. Agricultural workers continued to be excluded until the mid-1970s, when the efforts of NDP backbenchers persuaded their own government that agri\u00adcultural workers ought to be included in provincial collective bargaining laws. As demonstrated in a brief overview of the two campaigns to unionize agri\u00adcultural workers under BC\u2019s labour relations legislation since 1975, although small numbers of workers have been able to form unions and achieve collec\u00adtive agreements under the legislative protections of the Labour Code, those collective bargaining relationships have thus far proven unstable and often short-lived.",

C\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 partir d\u2019un portrait d\u2019ensemble de quelque quatre-vingts militants ouvriers de la premi\u00e8re heure, nous tenterons de poser certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments nouveaux de r\u00e9flexion sur cette p\u00e9riode tourment\u00e9e de notre histoire. Quelle lecture pouvons-nous faire des divers fragments de vie d\u2019ouvriers qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois engag\u00e9s dans des actions syndicales et revendicatives durant les ann\u00e9es 1830? En quoi leur exp\u00e9rience est-elle r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice d\u2019un milieu social \u00e0 cheval entre la tradition et la modernit\u00e9? D\u2019ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0, nous pouvons dire que ces premiers militants sont issus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de m\u00e9tiers (typographes, cordonniers, tailleurs d\u2019habits, charpentiers-menuisiers, etc.), dont le cadre normatif d\u2019ascension professionnelle \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement menac\u00e9 par l\u2019av\u00e8nement du march\u00e9 capitaliste du travail et par les premi\u00e8res tentatives de rationalisation du travail en manufacture. Outre le fait d\u2019avoir rendu possible la personnification des gestes et de la parole ouvri\u00e8re, cette recherche a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 la diversit\u00e9 et la polyvalence des engagements ouvriers (syndicats, coop\u00e9ratives, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de secours mutuel, associations civiques antimonopole, etc.) durant la p\u00e9riode, de m\u00eame que le r\u00f4le primordial jou\u00e9 par les bourses ouvri\u00e8res du travail, en vue de contr\u00f4ler l\u2019offre en main-d\u2019oeuvre dans les villes, et l\u2019importance de l\u2019id\u00e9ologie du r\u00e9publicanisme ouvrier aupr\u00e8s des classes populaires. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ce riche mat\u00e9riel biographique, nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement en mesure de d\u00e9couvrir l\u2019\u00e9tonnante ambivalence du monde ouvrier face au mouvement patriote et r\u00e9formiste des ann\u00e9es 1830.",

Connaissant les noms et les occupations de tout le personnel de deux des principales soci\u00e9t\u00e9s mini\u00e8res de la ville, la Lake Shore et la Wright-Hargreaves Gold Mines, nous avons cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si les mineurs \u00e9taient reli\u00e9s, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre, aux diff\u00e9rentes manifestations musicales rapport\u00e9es dans le journal local, le Northern News, tout au long de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1934.

        "abstractNote": "The Pacific Northwest underwent rapid economic growth in the late 19th century and cities on both sides of the Canada/US border burgeoned. The building boom was sustained by a large cohort of tradesmen and skilled labourers who lived in modest cabins, tenement blocks, boarding houses, and residential hotels. Most of these urban wageworkers were unmarried. They left few records of their experiences outside the job site or union hall. In this case study of Victoria, British Columbia circa 1891, we deployed a historical geographical information system (HGIS) to reconstitute the urban residential and social space of bout 2,000 otherwise elusive working men. Our research framework combines qualitative methods that are familiar to historians and quantitative methods favoured by geospatial researchers. By integrating both qualitative and quantitative data, we are able to represent the multiple spatial conditions experienced by Victoria's wageworkers in the early 1890s. In the process, we repopulated the city and reconstructed a largely vanished urban landscape. A primary objective of the essay is to demonstrate how GIS can be used as a research tool and new epistemology in the field of labour history.",

        "abstractNote": "Travel is one of many extra-legal barriers that restrict access to abortion services. Paradoxically, women travel at the international, domestic, and local levels to circumvent legal and/or extra-legal barriers to access. Through an examination of four specific Canadian responses to inequality of access to abortion services relative to shifts in the legal terrain from the 1960s onwards, the authors demonstrate that travel signifies an interruption to reproductive choice. Women went to Britain and the United States for an abortion when these countries relaxed their abortion legislation. Within Canada, women sought out the services offered by the Morgentaler Clinic in Montreal in order to avoid the abortion bureaucracy that limited their right to choose. In New Brunswick, the pro-life movement successfully lobbied hospitals to restrict abortion services, and the provincial government to deny funding for abortions performed in freestanding clinics, forcing women to travel to access abortion services. Pro-choice activists in southeastern British Columbia launched a successful campaign to protect hospital abortions, ensuring that rural women had access to abortion services within their home communities. Today, 25 years after the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the abortion law, abortion services are uneven at best and unattainable at worst in different regions of the country.",

        "abstractNote": "In February 1913, when a teacher at Montreal's Aberdeen School made disparaging remarks about her Jewish pupils, five boys called a strike. Hundreds of Jewish children congregated in the park across from the school where they appointed strike leaders, established a negotiating committee, and resolved not to return to class until the teacher apologized. Some of them marched to the Baron de Hirsch Institute and the newspaper office of the Keneder Adler to demand that action be taken. The Aberdeen students showed maturity in their understanding of \"the strike\" as a strategic response to perceived injustice, their politicization with respect to relations between the Jewish and Anglo-Protestant communities, and class consciousness. The years 1912 and 1913 had been arduous for working-class Jews living along the St-Laurent Street corridor who experienced a lengthy tailors' strike followed by an economic depression. The youthful strikers were acutely aware of the difficulties of being both working class and Jewish. We argue that the collective actions of the Aberdeen School strikers reveal a close connection to the labour activism of their parents and to the downtown Jewish community. Their response to the teacher's anti-Semitic comments is an example of the historical agency of children.",

        "abstractNote": "In mid-February 1949, workers at the Jeffrey Mine in Asbestos, Qu\u00e9bec, voted to strike against the American-owned Johns-Manville Company. This work stoppage precipitated a provincial industry-wide strike that lasted for almost five months. The 1949 Asbestos strike has been incorporated into Qu\u00e9bec's broader political historiography, and is generally regarded as a critical turning point in the history of labour and social relations in French-speaking Canada. Yet the environmental health aspects of the conflict in Asbestos remain largely unexamined. Showing how environmental health issues were a trigger for the strike and a sustained goal of the Asbestos workers seeking improvements in their conditions of work, this article demonstrates how central dust and disease were in the negotiations and arbitration hearings involving unionized workers and the company, both in 1949 and in the years that followed. It also accents the extent to which these environmental issues became health concerns that spread throughout the community. In looking at the Asbestos strike of 1949 through the lens of environmental concerns, fresh insight is gained about the nature of one of Canada's major labour conflicts, expanding our understanding of how health issues emerging in the workplace but extending well past it can affect the nature of everyday life and well being in a resource community.",

        "abstractNote": "Uranium miners in Elliot Lake went on a wildcat strike in 1974 to protest their occupational health concerns on the job after a spike in cancer cases. They learned that the provincial government had known of the poor working conditions causing their illnesses, but had not informed them of the dangers or acted to improve their situation. As a result of union and political pressure, the Ontario government created the Ham Commission to investigate and make recommendations. Its hearings revealed the industry's scandalous conditions, and its report eventually resulted in the Ontario Health and Safety (OHS) Act in Ontario. It did not cover the miners until 1984, so they worked through their internal health and safety committees to gain improvements in the work environment. Others have discussed this situation in relation to the emergence of the OHS and environmental movements. This paper discusses the events in terms of the mine owners' attitudes towards their employees, the industry's relationship to governments, and the impact of the uranium mining industry (part of the nuclear industry) on the local community and environment.",

        "abstractNote": "This article examines the resettlement of Japanese-Canadian internally displaced persons (IDPS), who were relocated from the West Coast of British Columbia to sugar beet communities in southern Alberta between 1942 and 1953. It argues that the IDPS, assisted both by pre-World War II Japanese residents in southern Alberta and by the federal government, contributed to the rising awareness of ethnic rights. For this purpose, my study adds two new angles to the study of human rights and Japanese Canadians. First, while ethnic activism for human rights has often been examined in an urban context, it was the negotiations in the local sphere between the Alberta Sugar Beet Growers' Association and Japanese IDPS that played a significant role in promoting human rights. Second, this study applies both local and transnational contexts to the question of Japanese-Canadian IDPS, which has hitherto been studied only in terms of state violence against, an ethnic minority. The Japanese IDPS retained Pure Land Buddhism as a symbol of their loyalty to Japan, and the religion strengthened its influence in southern Alberta as a focal point of their identity.",

        "abstractNote": "Drawing on historical sources and interviews, this paper discusses several key forces that have shaped the development of the snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) fishery in Newfoundland. Once commonly discarded as a pest, snow crab has emerged as the economic foundation of many rural coastal communities since the cod moratorium of the early 1990s. While this fishery has brought unprecedented prosperity to some commercial fishers, it has also been prone to significant price fluctuations and the benefits accruing from it have not been widely shared. Accordingly, it has also been marked by frequent and often bitter conflicts between different crab fishing fleet sectors and between crab fishers, processing companies, and processing plant workers. These tensions reflect fundamentally different visions of how to sustain the fishery into the future and which priorities should decide who benefits most from the crab resource.",

        "abstractNote": "What constitutes proletarianization? The conventional answer to this seemingly simple question often stresses waged labour. Yet many workers, past and present, are routinely unable,to secure paid employment, in part because of the persistence of capitalist crises of various kinds. This study of indigent workers in Toronto from the 1830s to the 1930s is premised on an understanding of proletarianization as dispossession, on the one hand, and, on the other, of the ways in which capitalism necessarily produces recurrent crises, leaving many workers wageless. It addresses how wagelessness and poverty were criminalized through the development of institutions of ostensible charitable relief, such as the Toronto House of Industry, in which those seeking shelter and/or sustenance were required to chop wood or, more onerously, break stone in order to be. admitted to the ranks of those 'deserving' of such support. By the end of the nineteenth century-resistance to such \"labour tests\" was increasingly evident. Protests took place in Toronto, where the black flag was carried in demonstrations demanding \"work or bread.\" Refusing to \"crack the stone\" and demands that relief be administered differently were common features of mobilizations of the wageless in the opening decades of the twentieth century, in which socialists often took the lead. By the time of capitalism's devastating collapse in the Great Depression of the 1930s, Toronto's wageless were well situated to mount an outcasts' offensive.",

        "abstractNote": "The British Columbia Teachers' Federation (bctf), representing all public elementary and secondary school teachers in the province, is one of the largest and most powerful unions in British Columbia. bctf has always sought formal rights to full-scope collective bargaining, and unrestricted access to striking at the school board level. It has employed a sustained, sophisticated series of strategies to achieve these objectives, quickly adapting to changing political and legal environments. The bctf has had significant success in advancing its labour relations agenda, establishing a different trajectory for teachers than for most public sector workers in Canada. This article maps bctf's labour relations strategies and agenda against the backdrop of the political and legal environments, from bctf's inception to present-day. It argues that, as a result of these factors, BC teachers have experienced a different labour relations history than most public sector workers. Drawing on and adapting Rose's (2004) eras of public sector labour relations, this article identifies the following eras of BC teacher labour relations: an era of exclusion (to 1982); resistance and revitalization (1982-86); expansion (1987-93); reform (1994); reprieve (1994-2001); restraint and consolidation (2002-2007); and reaching an era of realignment beginning in 2007.",

        "abstractNote": "As many of the traditionally unionized sectors of the economy experience crisis, unions are turning to social unionist strategies of coalition-building and community mobilization as a means of defending jobs through external solidarity. This paper explores the politics and dynamics of the Canadian Auto Workers' (caw) organization of a union-community coalition and rally in Windsor, Ontario as a means of defending the manufacturing base. The paper contends that while Windsor's May 2007 Manufacturing Matters rally was quite successful in its short-term aims, due to the caw's strong mobilizing structures and longstanding relationships between local unions and community organizations, internal coalition dynamics and framing processes led to decisions which limited the longer-term capacities of the campaign. The coalition opted to emphasize place over class as the unifying element, to produce non-adversarial discourses and tactics so as to avoid appearing anti-business, and to marginalize more militant talk and tactics. These outcomes raise questions about both the sustainability for ongoing solidarity and mobilization amongst the Windsor working class, and the capacity of the local labour movement to articulate counter-hegemonic interpretations of economic problems and promote policy options not dominated by the needs and interests of economic and political elites.",

        "abstractNote": "La Loi relative \u00e0 l'extension juridique des conventions collectives de travail est adopt\u00e9e par le gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec en 1934 pour prot\u00e9ger les travailleurs frapp\u00e9s par la crise \u00e9conomique et favoriser leur syndicalisation. Fruit de revendications des syndicats catholiques, elle porte un mod\u00e8le particulier de relations de travail qui ne s'imposera pas ailleurs en Am\u00e9rique du Nord. La loi, qui mise sur la collaboration patronale-syndicale, permet au gouvernement d'\u00e9tendre par d\u00e9cret \u00e0 toutes les entreprises d'un secteur industriel, dans un territoire d\u00e9termin\u00e9, les termes d''une convention collective conclue par un syndicat. Sa philosophie est issue de la doctrine sociale de l'\u00c9glise catholique avec comme but ultime la formation de corporation professionnelle, cellule de base de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 corporatiste.\n\nLa loi est adopt\u00e9e une ann\u00e9e avant le Wagner Act, la \u00abMagna Carta\u00bb du mouvement syndical aux \u00c9tats-Unis, qui inspire l'adoption de lois similaires Canada et au Qu\u00e9bec pendant la Deuxi\u00e8me Guerre. Cette loi apporte une dure concurrence \u00e0 la loi des d\u00e9crets qui demeure pr\u00e9sente cependant dans les industries o\u00f9 la concurrence est vive et o\u00f9 la main d'\u0153uvre repr\u00e9sente une forte proportion des co\u00fbts de production. Dans les ann\u00e9es 1970, la loi conna\u00eet un regain d'int\u00e9r\u00eat du cot\u00e9 des syndicats et des sp\u00e9cialistes de relations indus- trielles afin de faciliter l'accr\u00e9ditation sectorielle ou multi patronale. On juge que le cadre de n\u00e9gociation tr\u00e8s d\u00e9centralis\u00e9 selon le Code du travail ne r\u00e9pond plus aux transformations du march\u00e9 du travail. Depuis les ann\u00e9es 1980, le r\u00e9gime des d\u00e9crets est touch\u00e9 par la lib\u00e9ralisation des relations de travail dans le sillage du courant de pens\u00e9e n\u00e9olib\u00e9ral. Dans cet esprit, le gouvernement abolit en 1999 les d\u00e9crets de l'industrie du v\u00eatement, ce qui affecte 23 000 sala- ri\u00e9s. Au Qu\u00e9bec comme ailleurs, c'est tout le syst\u00e8me de relations de travail n\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es 1930 qui s'\u00e9rode \u00e0 mesure que le gouvernement se laisse gagner par la d\u00e9r\u00e9glementation des rapports collectifs de travail.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper critically examines diversity management in a multinational forest company in Saskatchewan, Canada. Drawing on insights from intersectionality theory, it highlights how white and Aboriginal women's experiences inform our understanding of workplace practices to include marginalized groups. Scholars in organization studies have critiqued diversity management for how its underlying individualism translates into a narrow understanding of difference. This critique is complicated by demonstrating how women's experiences and representations of diversity management were uneven. Women's portrayals of diversity management were structured by their gender, class, and by whether they were white or Aboriginal. Women's experiences and representations extend critiques of diversity management by uncovering some of the ways that corporate liberal ideology works through local constructions of difference. Since diversity management did not challenge white women's beliefs of meritocracy, it helped to re-inscribe racism towards Aboriginal peoples.",

        "abstractNote": "There is a growing body of research on African Canadians in the 19th century that touches on their experiences in the workforce. Nonetheless, the literature has been largely silent on how labour market opportunities for African Canadians altered over time and, in particular, how members of this community fared with the slow, but nonetheless dramatic, rise of an industrial-capitalist economy. This study uses census data to explore the occupational experiences of African Canadians living in London, Ontario, between 1861 and 1901. Findings suggest that labour market opportunities were better for men of African origins around mid-century but declined noticeably in the succeeding years. African Canadians of both genders were largely excluded from growth areas in the economy, and their labour was highly concentrated in a narrow range of low-skill jobs. Although there is limited evidence of upward occupational mobility over time for some, and a slight broadening of occupational opportunities by 1901, African Canadian men and women were disadvantaged compared to their white counterparts.",

        "abstractNote": "The Canadian labour revolt was about more than wages and working conditions. The year 1919 was also a moment of socialist possibility in which the Russian Revolution and the influence of Marx and Engels fuelled the revolutionary intent of a radicalizing Canadian working class. The idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat, long since lost in the shadow of Stalin\u2019s terror, fuelled this moment of socialist possibility. The longing for a workers\u2019 state was a nation-wide phenomenon, but it manifested itself more deeply and broadly in western Canada than in the east. West of the Great Lakes, the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat was hotly debated in the pages of socialist papers and in the halls of the labour movement. Knowledge of the debate concerning the dictatorship of the proletariat provides a more complete understanding of the labour revolt of 1919 and its legacy for Canadian history and the international left.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper examines the evolution of Ontario's tree planting industry and the segmentation of its labour force since the end of WorldWar II. To. do so, it draws upon Jamie Peck's causal emphases of labour market segmentation: labour demand, labour supply, and the state. Concomitantly, it seeks to better conceptualize tree planting amongst other forestry and seasonal natural resource occupations, such as loggers and agricultural workers. The paper is organized around four distinct time periods, all of which are marked by significant changes to the structure and political economy of the forest products industry and legislation governing forest tenure and management. It also examines mechanization in the logging and tree planting industries, the shift from public to private service delivery, the role of unions, remuneration systems, the potential for the use of migrant guest workers, and the ensuing effects on the segmentation, marginalization, and stigmatization of tree planters in Ontario since the mid-1940s.",

Ceci  s\u2019est  traduit  par  une  restructuration  de  plusieurs dispositifs  de  protection  sociale  qui  s\u2019est  r\u00e9alis\u00e9e  par  la  reconfiguration  des param\u00e8tres de protection et par l\u2019activation de ces m\u00eames d\u00e9penses sociales. Pour  comprendre  cette  restructuration,  cet  article  analyse  les  changements introduits dans certains dispositifs de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du revenu que sont le dispositif de  l\u2019assurance  ch\u00f4mage,  le  r\u00e9gime  universel  des  allocations  familiales  et le syst\u00e8me d\u2019assistance sociale, tant au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral que qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Pour rendre compte de cette d\u00e9marche, le texte a \u00e9t\u00e9 divis\u00e9 en trois parties : la premi\u00e8re porte sur la reconfiguration  de  chacun  des  dispositifs,  la  deuxi\u00e8me  sur  l\u2019activation des d\u00e9penses sociales et la troisi\u00e8me introduit des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019analyse vis-\u00e0-vis cette restructuration r\u00e9cente des politiques sociales. Le texte est travers\u00e9 par une  question,  celle  de  savoir  si  ces  r\u00e9formes  traduisent  un  virage  n\u00e9o-lib\u00e9ral dans le sens d\u2019un d\u00e9sengagement de l\u2019\u00c9tat et d\u2019une \u00e9rosion des droits sociaux ou  s\u2019il  vaut  mieux  plut\u00f4t  y  voir  une  r\u00e9organisation,  une  modification de son architecture, traduisant un changement de paradigme ou de r\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel dans le sens d\u2019un \u00c9tat social actif ou d\u2019investissement social.",

        "abstractNote": "The election of William Kolisnyk as alderman for Winnipeg's Ward Three in the fall of 1926 was celebrated as one of the first times that any candidate in North America running under the banner of a Communist Party was elected to public office. Although he was only an alderman for four years, a study of Kolisnyk's political life contributes to the study of communist history in several ways. His term in office was split roughly in half by the introduction of Third Period ideology. As the Communist Party's sole elected representative. at the time, Kolisnyk's political activity demonstrates the practical implications of this dramatic policy shift. While the Third Period radically changed Kolisnyk's politics, several local issues significantly influenced his politics. Ethnicity, both within the Party and in Kolisnyk's constituency, profoundly affected his career. The paper also examines the political issues pursued by communists at the municipal level and the communist community that brought Kolisnyk to office. Therefore, this examination of William Kolisnyk's aldermanic career reveals the importance of international influences as well as the political realities of Winnipeg's communist community, both of which contributed to the political activities of one of Canada's first elected communists.",

        "abstractNote": "The Ontario Labour Relations Act (OLRA) has long dictated the legal relationship between trade unions and employers in the province. Although subject to years of delay, when the provincial government introduced the OLRA in 1950, its official stance on labour relations was a \"hands off\" program that was designed to leave collective bargaining to the participants. Often defined as industrial pluralism, this new legal regime was supposed to have been crafted in the name of \"fairness and balance\" in which trade unions abandoned previous militancy for state-sponsored freedoms. Upon closer examination, however, the provincial government's approach to industrial pluralism was much less hands off than has previously been assumed. Rather, the entrenchment of collective bargaining in Ontario was closely aligned with the class interests of Ontario businesses. Through an examination of the politics surrounding OLRA, this article argues that Teslie Frost's Conservative government structured the Act in order to appease employer demands surrounding increased legal regulation of collective bargaining and union organizing, which limited the extension of unionization throughout the province. In making this observation, the article maintains that the Conservative regime of industrial pluralism was both the by-product and the purveyor of ongoing class antagonism throughout the 1950s.",

        "abstractNote": "Historians have long noted that policies of \"progress\" were integral to men and women throughout northern North America in the 19th century. A range of scholars have commented on the centrality of railway technology to these policies. Indeed, they have suggested that, in the 19th century, bourgeois nationalists were swept up in a kind of \"railway fever,\" and that even though there were detractors, the tenacity of pro-railway elites, and the considerable patronage that huge construction loans and contracts provided them, ensured that these projects triumphed over other possibilities. The Newfoundland case suggests that there is a need for both a slightly revised assessment of elites and their views and goals, and a more nuanced reading of the role of ordinary men and women in the policy-making process. While elites in the colony did view the railway as a means of becoming a \"progressive\" or \"modern nation,\" and while they viewed economic prosperity and \"enlightenment\" as central to modernity and progressiveness, commercial dynamism was only one important component of a more encompassing program. Tlites supported the railway because it provided them with a way of living according to standards of Britishness that became important to Newfoundlanders and others in \"white\" settler dominions, especially after the mid-19th century. Central to \"Britishness\" as policy makers understood the term, was the idea that \"British societies\" were those in which men lived according to their \"god given manly independence.\" A careful analysis of the daily press suggests that many working people took these ideals seriously, and that they saw railway work, and the future employment and other economic opportunities its promoters promised, as a means of living according to them. When opponents of railway development did maneuver themselves into power, they found efforts to change course were met with popular upheaval. Ultimately, it was a broadly based solidarity founded on notions of male entitlement that determined which policies were \"feasible.\"",

Les mineurs examin\u00e9s, qui font partie des travailleurs les mieux pay\u00e9s du secteur industriel  canadien,  ont  profit\u00e9  d\u2019une  organisation  du  travail  qui  les  sollicite \u00e0  faire  des  heures  suppl\u00e9mentaires  ou  \u00e0  toucher  des  primes  de  rendement. Ces  revenus  additionnels  tout  comme  les  hauts  salaires  que  commande  leur travail contribuent \u00e0 une pratique d\u2019absent\u00e9isme occasionnel qui se pr\u00e9sente sous  deux  formes : des  semaines  de  vacances  non  pay\u00e9es  et  le  prolongement du cong\u00e9 dominical pour profiter de ce qu\u2019on appellera la fin de semaine. Ces pratiques, qui varient d\u2019une mine \u00e0 l\u2019autre et selon le type de travail, sont ainsi en place bien avant l\u2019adoption des deux semaines de vacances en Ontario en 1944 et  bien  avant  l\u2019adoption de la  semaine de  travail de  40 heures au  d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1950. Les absences au travail ne seraient donc pas seulement provoqu\u00e9es par des accidents, des maladies ou du ch\u00f4mage, mais elles pourraient \u00eatre aussi volontaires, signalant ainsi la tr\u00e8s grande ind\u00e9pendance de ces travailleurs face au patronat.",

        "abstractNote": "By the mid-19th century, the Mi'kmaq of Cape Breton Island, much like the Mi'kmaq on the Nova Scotia mainland, were nearly destitute. The outcome of over two centuries of political, economic, and cultural interaction with Europeans, this condition was exacerbated by the massive influx of Scottish settlers to the island after the end of the Napoleonic Wars -- nearly 30,000 between 1815 and 1838. With their lands occupied and access to customary hunting and fishing grounds severely limited, the island's Mi'kmaw population -- estimated to be about 500 in 1847 -- adopted numerous economic initiatives to stay alive: they pursued agriculture and wage labour, mobilized older skills toward different occupational niches, and maintained, at least to some extent, customary rounds of seasonal resource procurement. This essay examines this evolving pattern of occupational pluralism, and highlights how customary norms, codes, and behaviours provided part of the logic through which the island's Mi'kmaw people made decisions about what to do, economically, to survive. Mid-19th century Cape Breton was a contested place as the forces of immigration and settlement exerted new pressures on Mi'kmaw life. This paper is about that changing context and how the island's indigenous people sought to understand it, negotiate its pressures and possibilities, and blunt its negative effects.",

Less attention has been paid to the impact of Metis concepts of family and community on the nature of their relationship with their employer, the Hudson's Bay Company (hbc). This article focuses on how Metis family structures in the English River District molded the contours of the community's relationship with the hbc in the 19th century. More specifically, only certain families established a relationship with the Company, wherein male servants and their extended families laboured for the hbc in return for wages and/or access to Company resources. The Company's willingness to participate in these types of exchanges with its employees' families cultivated an intergenerational loyalty amongst those Metis, as successive generations were employed by the Company and, in turn, drew upon it as part of their economic resource network. Still, Company officials faced a dilemma. They recognized that these extended families were loyal contributors to the Company's trading successes, but likewise regarded them as burdensome and a drain on precious resources. Throughout the 19th century, the ambivalence of the Company grew, negatively impacting its relationship with once loyal hbc servants and their families. The loyalty of families to the Company was only as strong as its loyalty to them. By the end of the century, as the Company's focus turned to reducing its obligations to families, Metis loyalties also shifted to competing economic ventures, thereby threatening the hbc monopoly in the region.",

        "abstractNote": "Aboriginal women have a long history of paid labour in Canada, yet there is little scholarly writing examining their work experiences. Using enfranchisement case files for the Ontario Indian agencies of Parry Sound and Manitowaning, supplemented by oral histories from the Tyendinaga Mohawks, this article explores the work lives of Anishinabe and Mohawk women in the 1920s and 1930s. Aboriginal women's economic roles involved a continuum of labour ranging from non-cash-oriented subsistence production to commercially-oriented farming, handicraft production, and berry-picking, to wage labour in the capitalist economy. In response to increasing economic hardship on the reserves, First Nations men and women turned increasingly to off-reserve wage labour. While men around Georgian Bay had access to seasonal jobs in lumbering, sawmilling, transportation, and tourism, women faced much more limited employment opportunities in the area. Some responded by moving to towns and cities to work. Further south, the Mohawk women of Tyendinaga could take domestic service jobs and commute from the reserve, or they could move to larger cities to work. For both groups of women, as for women in general, domestic labour was the most common occupation. The Tyendinaga women also had considerable involvement in manufacturing and migrant farm labour. A few women from both groups were able to finish high school and obtain clerical jobs, which offered better pay and shorter hours. Aboriginal women's occupational distributions were similar to those of other women in the labour force, especially working-class, immigrant, and racialized women. Contrary to today's persistent media images of Aboriginal unemployment, their records and reminiscences reveal lifetimes of hard work, self-support, and self-respect.",

        "abstractNote": "In the 1950s and 1960s, Aboriginal gillnet fishers protested new state salmon regulations restricting access to the industrial fishery of the Nass and Skeena Rivers in northern British Columbia. Using cannery records, as well as letters, petitions, and statements native people made to the Department of Fisheries, this article examines both the protests and the impact of the regulations that the state introduced in a time of massive structural, economic, technological, and ecological change in the northern fishery. The native fishers' letters suggest that both their Aboriginal heritage and work-centered, class-based identities were shaping their opposition to the state. Those leading the protests were active in other areas of native politics, but also strongly identified as gillnetters, small-boat fishers in an increasingly stratified and competitive fishery. Moreover, native fishers in British Columbia had had a long history of labour activism and organization. This article suggests that understanding the ways these Aboriginal groups navigated between both the colonial and capitalist legacies can provide insights into native politics and experiences in this period.",

Moreover, this article argues that even within a politically polarized immigrant group such as the Ukrainians, where left/right, progressive/ nationalist, and secular/religious splits were so pronounced, and thus central to shaping the histories and historiographies of both camps, it was the influence of dominant gender roles rather than politics, religion, or ideology that most directly informed the differing memories of experience that men and women had of growing up Ukrainian and working class in Sudbury. In particular, this article focuses on informants' recollections regarding three areas of activity that were part of everyday boarding house life: children's relationships with male boarders, their domestic chores, and leisure activities.",

While much has been written on the Winnipeg General Strike and 1919 Canadian labour revolt, the Victoria General Strike is revealing as a contested expression of working-class solidarity, an illustration of the unresolved tension between craft and industrial unionism and different labour leaderships in the west-coast city. Much of British Columbia labour had embraced the One Big Union and its socialist leadership by the spring of 1919, but Victoria's organized workers wavered on the question of striking in sympathy with Winnipeg's working class. While the shipyards were a locus of militancy, influential groups of workers, AFL rather than OBU in orientation, opposed a general strike and undermined the mood of solidarity. Local conditions in different economic sectors shaped the working-class response to the Winnipeg General Strike. This tension provides fresh insight into the development of class consciousness and industrial militancy at the end World War I, breaking new ground in the historiography of Canada's postwar labour revolt.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper focuses on the experiences of children and youth who were born into the Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association (ULFTA) during the 1920s and 1930s. It examines the priorities of the movement's parents and male leaders and their efforts to implement activities that would serve to politicize and impart a strong sense of Ukrainianness in youngsters. It also considers the ways in which young people themselves contributed to the shape of the movement. Children and youth, because of their particular positions at specific intersections of class, ethnicity, age, and gender, experienced the ULFTA in ways that were distinct from their parents. Because of the ULFTA's emphasis on Ukrainian culture, their childhoods were also significantly different from other socialist children. The movement's emphasis on Marxist-Leninism and the class struggle also divided these children from their non-socialist Ukrainian and non-Ukrainian peers. By applying an intersectional perspective to the interwar Ukrainian left, this paper also seeks to broaden our understanding of the movement's connection with the Communist Party of Canada (CPC). The ULFTA and the CPC enjoyed a consistently difficult relationship through much of this period, particularly where Ukrainian cultural expression was concerned. An examination of youngsters' activities illustrates some of the many ways in which the ULFTA leaders and rank-and-file members (including the young people themselves) resisted the CPC's attempts to control the ULFTA and its resources.",

Forster mapped for his readers a dialectic: Nature -- an antimodern pastoral refuge where hoboes lived in freedom -- stood against the City -- a wholly modern capitalist nightmare, home to economic exploitation and its attendant moral degradations. Yet, the author also articulated his desire to destroy this way of life -- and the foundation of his claims to authority as a writer -- in order to effect his and every hobo's reintegration with society. Casting off his avowed allegiance to tramping, Forster divined for his readers a third social formation, a new kind of capitalism infused with a Christian ethos of brotherhood and cooperation, and propped up by an unbounded white supremacy and a rigidly patriarchal division of labour. Herein lies the tragedy of Vancouver Through the Eves of a Hobo: to save the hobo required the destruction of the hobo way of life.",

        "abstractNote": "[This] study shows that the crisis of war reinforced pre-existing social and economic inequality based on racist views and practices. War-induced anxieties intensified suspicion of \"foreigners\" -- a term which encompassed large numbers of Canadian-born and naturalized people of Japanese, central, eastern, and southern European descent and Jews -- as unpatriotic, disloyal, radical, and incapable of becoming truly Canadian. The war also brought sharply into focus and even intensified racist assumptions that African Canadians, eastern and southern Europeans, and Native people were suitable only for menial jobs; that Jewish, Chinese, and Japanese Canadians were economically aggressive; and that Jews in particular were given to shady practices. Such racist stereotypes in turn legitimized the ongoing marginalization of these minorities in the workforce. The state colluded in racist practices. To be sure not all state officials or all Canadians were racist, but the pragmatism that informed official complicity with employment discrimination underscores the pervasiveness of racism in wartime Canada. State officials -- some of whom held racist ideas -- were willing to accept employers' and workers\" racist preferences because they believed that to do otherwise would create social unrest and disrupt war industries. Moreover, officials found that the relegation of minority groups such as Chinese Canadians, Japanese Canadians, and Native people to menial work offered the important benefit of filling jobs that Canadians with wider options avoided.",

Not only did they encourage their employees to become avid consumers, so did they market their employees' activities, interests, and bodies. They undertook these commodiyfing gestures in an attempt to extract value from their workforces. Investigating the rise and operation of commodification at these major retailers, this paper offers new insights into corporate management systems, demonstrates that commodification had negative consequences for employees, and provides fresh perspectives on 20th-century consumer capitalism.",

This paper begins a reclamation of that legacy by analysing the bitter 1961-1962 strike at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto, Canada's most luxurious lodgings. The unsuccessful battle of mostly immigrant workers against a powerful corporation anticipates the multinational consolidation of and asymmetrical struggle in the industry over the next four decades. The paper evaluates strategies used by service workers, explores the different historical dynamics of service-work trade unionism, analyses the cultural contests which sprang up around such a powerful symbolic action, and seeks to explain what lessons have been learned by current Toronto hotel activists. It represents one starting point in the important work of understanding service work activism, and the economic, political, and cultural battles around class, gender, ethnicity, and consumption in Canada.",

        "abstractNote": "At the height of World War II labour unrest, Montr\u00e9al tramway workers, the majority of whom were French Canadian, struck over recognition of their Canadian Congress of Labour-affiliated union over two entrenched rival unions. The strike, which threatened critical wartime production in Canada's largest industrial centre, illustrates how multi-union workplaces were a source of wartime industrial disorder. Circumstances related to the strike tested the capacity of the federal government to respond in a way which was compatible with Prime Minister King's broader goals of industrial stability and national unity. King's inaction on labour law reform at this time led key cabinet ministers to pursue criminal charges against the parties involved in the tramway strike. However, legal proceedings were obverted after King intervened on a recommendation from Carl Goldenberg, who had successfully conciliated the strike. Concurrent to these events was the announcement of a wide-ranging public inquiry into national labour unrest, which eventually led to the adoption of a new labour code (PC 1003). The new federal labour law adopted provisions similar to those in the US Wagner Act, which severely limited union substitution, subjugating worker free choice and collective self-determination to the goals of capital and the state.",

        "abstractNote": "Compared to Canada, Australian trade union membership grew dramatically in the period from 1900 to 1914. Through a comparative analysis of two iron and steel plants in Canada and Australia, this article broadens the debate about union growth in this particular period as well as generally. One plant was located at Lithgow, New South Wales, and the other at Sydney, Nova Scotia. While workers at both plants unionized in September-October 1902, the union at the Sydney plant collapsed following a major strike in 1904. Iron and steel unionism did not revive at the Sydney plant until during World War I. With the exception of a brief period, iron and steel unionism continued at the Lithgow plant for the period under examination. This article attempts to explain why iron and steel unionism persisted at Lithgow rather than Sydney and focuses on the factors of the state, the ethnic diversity of the workforce, management, and community or locality.",

        "abstractNote": "Iin British Columbia in the spring of 2004, over 40,000 hospital and long-term care facility workers, mostly members of the Hospital Employees Union [HEU], struck to defend their jobs and services against attacks from an aggressive neoliberal government and employers. This strike was distinguished by the social composition of the workforce, the fact that HEU had one of the more left-wing leaderships in the Canadian labour movement, and the determination of the strikers to persevere even in the face of back-to-work legislation. HEU'S resistance evoked an unusual degree of support that took the form of active solidarity rather than just passive sympathy. The BC labour leadership was pushed towards a confrontation of the kind that the existing regime of industrial legality was designed to prevent. This article identifies the systemic causes of the BC health care strike in public sector restructuring and the building of a lean state, explores its background, traces its trajectory, and explains and assesses its outcome. This strike highlights the significance of the character of the contemporary labour officialdom as a social layer whose conditions of existence lead it to usually oppose forms of collective action outside the bounds of industrial legality.",

During this period labour leaders were unquestionably disillusioned with the established churches and did not hesitate to criticize clergy-men for their indifference and hostility to labour's cause. This disillusionment did not mean, however, that organized labour abandoned religion. Both moderate reformist and radical labour leaders articulated a non-sectarian, activist Christianity that helped them frame the issues they were concerned about. Alliances also developed between the churches and labour bodies at the national level and labour-friendly clergy and a small group of labour leaders in industrial centres in southern Ontario.",

D'une dur\u00e9e de trois mois, l'interruption du travail oppose une locale de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des travailleurs catholiques du Canada [CTCC] \u00e0 une puissante entreprise commerciale et symbole national de l'\u00e9conomie canadienne-fran\u00e7aise (Dupuis Fr\u00e9res). L'historiographie de l'apr\u00e8s-guerre n'accorde pas une grande place \u00e0 ce conflit, qui, \u00e0 l'encontre d'aurres conflits mieux connus \u2014 telle la gr\u00e8ve de l'amiante (1949) et la gr\u00e8ve de Murdochville (1957), s'est solde par une \u00e9clatante victoire du syndicat. L'article examine d'abord le contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et les conditions sp\u00e9cifiques qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 le d\u00e9clenchement de la gr\u00e8ve.

        "abstractNote": "This paper presents a reinterpretation of the causes for the US Patriot movement of 1837-38, which rose up in support of the Canadian rebellion in Upper Canada (UC) initiated by William Lyon Mackenzie (the companion rebellion in Lower Canada is not considered in this paper since its causation was arguably considerably different). Most traditional treatments of this event, by US historians in particular, are stuck in narrative mode and lack convincing interpretation and analysis. The US Patriot war is usually quickly dismissed as the work of a few Anglophobes and adventurers seeking land and coin. The hypothesis advanced here suggests that the US Patriot movement and its progenitor rebellion in UC may be seen as an expression of the social class tensions growing out of the transition from a subsistence-barter/household economy and culture to the more impersonal commodity market economy - a transition that was proceeding in an uneven and combined manner on both sides of the nominal Canada/US border. Mackenzie's UC rebellion was both motivated by and encouragement to radical Democratic anti-bank forces in the US. Historians are urged to consider the Patriot movement in the larger context of class conflict and accommodation then being played out on a shared Canadian/American stage.",

        "abstractNote": "Canada's oldest and largest public housing project. Regent Park in Toronto, was originally conceived as an ideal community for low-income families in housing hardship. By the 1990s, however, it had become virtually synonymous with socio-economic marginalization and behavioural depravity. Indeed, the broader social identity of Regent Park has become an accumulation and escalation of the stigma of its residents. The first section of this article charts the historical escalation of polarization between Regent Park residents and the Metropolitan Toronto population by comparing a series of broadly illustrative statistical traits over a 40-year period. This long-term historical perspective allows us to scrutinize the development of socio-economic marginalization both before and after the boom period of postwar capitalism from the 1940s to the 1970s. It confirms that Regent's resident population underwent a dramatic process of socio-economic divergence in comparison to the general Metropolitan Toronto population, which began in the mid to late 1960s before the onset of outright assaults on the welfare state. I flesh out the stark statistical portrayal by considering various qualitative sources such as oral testimony, letters to the author by former tenants, rare resident case files, and internal and public documents from the various housing authorities. In the second section, I explain the rise of socio-economic inequality. Contrary to currently popular underclass theories, I directly point the arrow of responsibility for rising poverty and inequality towards state housing policies, including wider urban renewal strategies and internal public housing practices, and neoliberal economic restructuring. Unlike most studies, I centre in a third section on the potently deleterious effects of stereotyping Regent Park as an outcast space. Stigmatizing renderings by extemal observers were not free-floating ideological representations but real reflections and shapers of spatial and social divisions with concrete economic and social consequences for tenants. I conclude by discussing what residents themselves thought about their homes and how they coped with stigmatization and material deprivation. Sometimes accepting and internalizing negative external representations and/or projecting these labels onto their neighbours and other times resolutely battling against these brutalizing depictions. Regent Park residents were always active players in building a meaningful living space.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper discusses the appropriation of a work of popular culture as a tactic in a politics of cultural hegemony. The work in question, Michel Tremblay's play Les Belles-Soeurs, is particularly interesting as it is the first working-class cultural production shown in public in the new Qu\u00e9bec of the 1960s, where the Quiet Revolution was in full bloom. After sixteen years of conservative government and Church domination in the cultural domain, the province was led by a liberal govemment whose members were mostly from the urban petty-bourgeoisie. The field of cultural production changed markedly. The study illustrates a project of cultural critique in newspapers with differing audiences. It reveals the tactics adopted to accommodate and recuperate this irruption of popular culture. It compares the treatment of Les Belles-Soeurs by French reviewers in Qu\u00e9bec with those in France and with English reviewers in Canada.",

S'inspirant de ces travaux, cet article examine le travail accompli par la Commission du salaire minimum des femmes du Qu\u00e9bec, entre sa mise sur pied en 1925 et son d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement en 1937. Apr\u00e8s avoir expos\u00e9 les raisons qui poussent le gouvernement qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois \u00e0 l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur cette question, l'auteur pr\u00e9sente la position des syndicats internationaux et des syndicats catholiques face au travail f\u00e9minin. Au terme de l'analyse du mode de fonctionnement de la commission et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, d'une \u00e9valuation critique des m\u00e9canismes d'application de la loi, l'auteur arrive \u00e0 la conclusion qu'\u00e0 l'instar des autres commissions \u00e0 travers le Canada, la Commission du salaire minimum des femmes du Qu\u00e9bec n'aura pas permis l'augmentation du salaire des femmes. Dans un contexte socio-\u00e9conomique o\u00f9 les femmes gagnent en moyenne la moiti\u00e9 du salaire des hommes, la d\u00e9cision de faire du salaire minimum un outil pour lutter contre les abus du syst\u00e8me capitaliste aura pour principale cons\u00e9quence le maintien des bas salaires. En d\u00e9finitive, les faibles taux de salaires minimums consentis par la commission consacrent le principe de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 des salaires selon le sexe, refl\u00e9tant ainsi l'id\u00e9ologie dominante de l'\u00e9poque qui consid\u00e8re le travail de la femme comme marginal.",

        "abstractNote": "Working-class Hamiltonians responded to s local housing crisis by creating a boathouse community along the shoreline of Burlington Bay and Dundas Marsh. Leasing or simply squatting the land, they enjoyed access to good fishing and hunting, a clean place to live, and seclusion from the gaze of best police. The notorious reputation of a nearby hotel, the presence of transients in the area, and rough elements of working-class recreation, however, made the community a prime target for urban reformers. They saw it as an unsightly problem, standing in the way of their plans to create an aesthetically-pleasing, moral, and orderly city. The \"war on the squatters\" shows the ways in which urban planners, conservationists, and moral reformers sought to reshape the human and natural environment of the bay, often at the expense of working people. Residents who had enjoyed resource and recreational advantages of living on the margins of Hamilton society paid the price politically when reformers contested their use of the area's natural resources. Although they won limited sympathy, they did not have the economic, legal, or political resources to fight those who saw their community as an aesthetic and moral blot on Hamilton's waterfront.",

The study focuses on the town of Dresden, Ontario, which at one time was infamous for its treatment of blacks. When a number of organizations (including labour groups) lobbied the Ontario government to create Canada's first Fair Accommodation Practices Act, they pointed to Dresden as an example of why this legislation was necessary. After the legislation was passed, they used litigation to ensure that discrimination in Dresden would come to an end. The paper demonstrates that, although the trade union movement in Canada was not free from racism, it nevertheless played an important and under-appreciated role in fighting for egalitarian human rights.",

However, a tiny number of Black men have long had a presence in the industry, occupying the dirtiest, most hazardous, and least desirable jobs in the auto foundries of St. Catharines and Windsor, Ontario. This paper attempts to reconstruct the working lives and union involvements of these men. The paper highlights the themes of racialization and gendering within the sphere of capitalist production. In examining multiple oppressions, simultaneously experienced and resisted, the study furthermore demonstrates the ways in which relations of domination are far more complex and historically-contingent than most analyses of industry and \"the auto worker\" have suggested.",

It presents race as a central organizing principle in employers' decision to hire black railwaymen for their sleeping and dining car departments. Canadian railway managers actively sought out African American, West Indian, and African Canadian labour, believing that they constituted an easily manipulated group of workers. White railroaders fought the introduction of black employees, arguing that they undermined white manhood and railway unionism. Trade union leaders demanded and won a racialized division of the workforce, locking black workers into low-waged service position when they had initially enjoyed a broader range of employment options. In effect, white railway trade unionists and their employers embraced segregation as a rational model for peaceful working conditions. Black railroaders, on the other hand, resisted the encroachment of segregationist policies by forming their own union, the Order of Sleeping Car Porters. They pressured for change by exposing the scope of Jim Crow practices in the railway industry and trade unionism.",

        "abstractNote": "This essay provides a selective overview of the Canadian historiography on family. The roots of family history not only extend backwards much further than the \"new social history\" born of the tumultuous 1960s, they are buried deep in several other disciplines, most notably sociology, anthropology, and demography, whose practitioners were concerned as much with the historical process of family change as with the state of families contemporary to their times. I consider how pioneering social scientists, by grappling with the family's relationship to structural change, historicized early 20th century family studies and offered up many of the questions, concepts, th\u00e9ories, and methods that continue to inform historical scholarship on families. Turning to the body of historical publications that followed in the wake of, and were often inspired by, the \"new social history,\" I highlight the monograph studies that served as signposts in the field's development, especially for what they have revealed about the critical nexus of family, work, and class. The historiography mirrors the family 's history: \"family\" consists of so many intricately plaited strands that separating them out is frustrating and often futile. I have attempted to classify this material both topically and chronologically within broad categories, but the boundaries blur so that most of these works could fit as comfortably in several others. Many of them, in fact, will be recognized as important contributions to fields such as labour, ethnic, women's, or gender history rather than as works of family history per se.",

        "abstractNote": "This paper explores the writing of women's labour history in Canada over the last thirty years. Three interconnected forces have shaped the contours of this intellectual production: the course of feminist, Left, and labour organizing; trends in international social theory; and directions in Canadian historiography. Feminist challenges to the initially 'masculinist' shape of working-class history, along with more recent calls to integrate race and ethnicity as categories of analysis, have produced important shifts in the overall narrative of Canadian working-class history and in the dominant paradigms used to examine labour. As a result, gender has been more effectively, though certainly not completely, integrated into our analysis of class formation. More recent post-structuralist theoretical trends, along with the decline of the Left and labour militancy, have called into question some fundamental suppositions of women's and working-class history, creating an unsettled and uncertain future for a feminist and materialist exposition of class formation in Canada.",

Specifically, Vancouver, BC, 1945-1980, acts as a case study for the exploration of postwar erotic entertainment -- burlesque, go-go dancing, and striptease. Preliminary archival and ethnographie findings reveal the working conditions and artistic influences of former dancers, the racialized expectations of erotic spectacle, and the queer dimensions of strip culture. Adored and celebrated by fans, stripteasers also laboured under the 'whore stigma' circulated by moral reformers, the popular press, and the police. It is this tension between the reverence and the hostility aroused by erotic dancers that forms a central theme of the paper.",

Canadian workers do appear in a variety of documentary and feature film productions, but their presence often arises from the incidental processes of documentation and fictionalization. There is also a more purposeful body of work focused on the concerns of labour history, but its promise remains relatively underdeveloped. Although film has become one of the dominant languages of communications at the end of the 20th century, the practice of visual history stands to benefit from closer collaboration between historians and filmmakers.",

        "abstractNote": "During most of their history, Canadian universities, institutions staffed by and serving largely middle class people, have not been hospitable to organized labour or the political left. Professors who expressed support for such causes generally found that doing so often strained the limits of academic freedom as it was understood by governing boards, administrators, a good many academics, and many people outside the institutions. If the situation has improved during the last three decades, one reason is that faculty unions have become commonplace. More important, however, may be that the outside world has come to pay less attention to what professors say, on almost any subject, than used to be the case.",

        "abstractNote": "In the wake of President Roosevelt's New Deal for labour in the us, the International Woodworkers of America (IWA) experienced tremendous growth in Oregon and Washington. Fearing the arrival of the IWA in BC, the provincial government enacted the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration (ICA) Act as a means to stanch the growth of militant industrial unionism. It was at the company town of Blubber Bay, BC, that the ICA Act was tested for the first rime as capital, labour, and the state struggled over the pith and substance of the new legistation. Drawing on the insights of critical legal theorists and neo-institutionalists, this article examines the multiple ways in which the state, law, and legal process shaped both the formation of the IWA and the nature of class struggle itself. In particular, it illustrates how the expansion of formal collective bargaining, as well as the age-old legal remedies available at common and criminal law, worked together to set limits and erect boundaries on collective working-class action and, in the end, forge a \"responsible union.\"",

For British Columbia this neglect is a real oversight because hotel saloons were transformed into hotel beer parlours after prohibition. The first parlours opened in Vancouver in 1925, and, like saloons, they catered to a working-class clientele. Parlours held sway until 1954 when a new Government Liquor Act provided for additional venues of public drinking. One did not have to sit long in a Vancouver parlour to realize that more than alcohol consumption was being regulated. Parlours also regulated class, gender and sexuality, and race.",

We argue that Aircrafter functioned as an ideological mechanism by which pre-war, middle-class prescriptions of femininity, emphasizing women's roles as decorative homemakers in the private sphere, survived the challenges of women's war work to shape post-war gender roles. The article demonstrates the efficacy of this ideological mechanism by revealing the comprehensive way in which different rhetorical styles and varied sections of the newspaper -- the front page news and pictures, the editorial page, the women's page entitled \"The Femmine Touch,\" as well as cartoons and pin-ups -- collectively conveyed an ambivalent attitude that both praised and questioned women's war work in traditionally male jobs thus reinforcing pre-war socially prescribed forms of femininity. This research reveals how state policies concerning representations of women workers in government war propaganda influenced a northwestern Ontario war plant and shaped the ideological atmosphere which the women war workers at Canadian Car would have to negotiate as part of their daily working lives.",

        "abstractNote": "In March 1919, over 230 union delegates assembled at the Western Labor Conference in Calgary to chart a radical new direction for wage workers through the creation of a revolutionary industrial union centre, the One Big Union (OBU). This essay argues that the practices of the OBU's radical manhood, their particular sense of what it meant to be a union man, shaped the organization's structure and politics as well as the emergent culture which fostered such widespread working-class radicalism. Drawing upon already existing practices espoused by Canadian labourists and American Wobblies as well as fashioning new ones, OBU men distinguished radical manhood from both the class politics and the masculinities of male bosses and scabs. While the organization of working women was not seen as an important issue at the WLC, the upsurge in women's militancy during the labour revolt prompted OBU supporters to encourage these women to join their male comrades. At times, advocates of the One Big Union posed the questions of women's oppression and emancipation as crucial elements of the union's purpose; their infrequent ideological commitment, however, too often failed to translate into organizational gains for working-class women and the development of feminist practices within the union. In their challenge to the bourgeois order, OBU men created a program that, in the prevailing context of gender relations, meant that the One Big Union would bring about the transformation, but not the eradication, of men's power.",

Although the Lumber Workers Industrial Union no. 120, affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World, was smaller than its rival, the Lumber Workers Industrial Union of Canada, affiliated with the Communist Party, the Wobbly union played a major role in bushworker strikes in the mid-1920s and early 1930s. Committed to anti-authoritarianism, decentralization, and rank-and-file initiative, Finnish Wobbly bushworkers were part of an ethnic-based working-class culture in which the economic struggles of the bushworkers were made possible by the tireless work of Finnish Wobbly women, who were the backbone of Wobbly social, cultural, and organizational life in urban centres like Port Arthur. In a 20th century dominated by bureaucracy, legality, and state-directed social programs, the Finnish Wobblies of northern Ontario leave a legacy of dedication to self-education and self-activity in an age so often identified with the demise of the Wobblies and the victory of mass culture.",

Catholic \"spies\" and informants kept the Church abreast of communist maneuverings in ethnic communities, religious organizations, and on university campuses. An extensive moral and educational campaign was launched by the Church to create a bulwark against the Reds. These actions highlight the historical role of voluntary organizations in the policing of citizens and the maintenance of national security. Policing is redefined as a phenomenon that operated beyond the exclusive domain of the state. The analysis seeks to introduce a broader notion of national security and policing by examining the interplay between public and private institutions.",

        "abstractNote": "Rather than seeing the mainstream, anti-communist labour leadership in the post-war era as opponents of membership activism and as politically right wing, we might more accurately see them as ideologically-diverse architects of an activism designed to suit the institutional conditions of the new industrial legality in the Cold War era. Labour bureaucrats they indisputably were, but the new regime of industrial relations prompted them to re-examine and to attempt to democratize the basis of their institutional power. Evidence for this thesis is supplied through a study of welfare work and its promoters. Further evidence lies in a survey of idological interpretations of union welfare work and the political uses to which it was put.",

The CEIU has used client coalitions to defend and transform its membership, and these efforts have been aided by the contradictions of the neoconservative project itself. Union successes have occurred when clients and community groups are on side, real material gains are conceivable, and the issues at stake impinge on the discretionary decisions of frontline workers. Union efforts are seen to constitute a prototypical strategy of \"countermanagement,\" which can establish the foundations for a new, more democratically-accountable state.",

This effort drew the support of steel workers in a way that previous organizing attempts had not. However, the militant and self-reliant traditions of the steel workers collided with the cautious strategies and bureaucratic practices of the appointed SWOC leadership in the United States and Canada. As steel workers at Sydney showed great solidarity in their struggle with DOSCO, they also resisted what they saw as undemocratic and highly accommodationist practices by the union's national and international leadership. The struggles within the union embraced the issues of Canadian autonomy and nationalism as well as rank-and-file union control and the democratic rights of union members. It amounted to a struggle over what type of unionism was to be established within the Canadian steel industry.",

This article assesses the historiography of collective violence since the 1960s and offers specific suggestions for further exploration into Canada's riotous experiences. Scholars often assume that Canada's collective violence has been infrequent and less destructive than American episodes. Future research -- with a focus on nativism, the social legitimacy of the crowd, religious and ethnic conflict, the entrenchment of powerful state institutions, and vigilantism -- might prove otherwise. Regardless, Canadian collective violence will be better understood if it is conceptualized in a North Atlantic context.",

        "abstractNote": "In August 1964, the souther Ontario local 523 of the United Electrical and Radio Machine Workers led some 450 female auto-parts workers onto the picket-line. A year later, the same union local led over 1,200 male steelworkers in a strike against the Steel Company of Canada. In both cases, Italian immigrants joined with their non-Italian co-workers in a show of class solidarity. Italian men framed their decision to strike in terms of a manly duty as the family's decision maker and breadwinner; Italian women assumed the role of aggressive labour militant with relative equanimity, while the more outwardly militant Italian men expressed considerable personal uncertainty and fear even while they engaged in a public display of cross-ethnic class solidary. The paper explores how gender, class and ethnicity interact to influence the dynamics of labour militancy in the two strikes, though it also gives due consideration to the structural factors that helped to determine the outcome of both strikes.",

As well as exploring new terrain in the history of youth and higher education in Canada, this study adds to the literature on the means by which liberal democratic practices were fettered by government authorities in the depression and war years.",

By repudiating rank-and-file initiatives against various dimensions of management control of the labour process, the new unionism displaced a potentially transformative kind of unionism that arose during the war. The significance of this transition is explored through a comparative examination of the relations between union leaders and members at two autoworker locals, one of which exemplified the ran-and-file-oriented local unionism of the war years, the other the new centralized unionism which came in its wake. It is argued that this transition to a new unionism was a key contributor to the marginalization of class-based politics in Canada after the war.",

The working conditiona, causea. and outcome of the strike were typical of the situation for unskilled labourers on large construction projects in the 19th century. The workers gained their back pay, but little else. At the same time, the strike contributed to the loss of the contract by the contractor, Joseph Whitehead, and perhaps also contributed to the end of the small contract system of building the transcontinental railway.",

        "abstractNote": "In the period following World War II, Alberta's Social Credit government passed several pieces of restrictive legislation which limited labour's ability to organize workers and to call strikes. The enforcement of labour law also reflected an anti-union bias. This article argues that Social Crediters, who had a penchant for conspiracy theories, believed that union militancy was the product of the manoeuverings of an international communist conspiracy. Their labour legislation was intended to foil the conspiracy's plans in Alberta and incidentally to reassure potential investors, particularly in the oil patch, of a good climate for profit-taking. But the path for such legislation was made smoother by the conservatism of one wing of the labour movement in the province and the fear of being tarnished with the communist brush by the other wing. On the whole, the Alberta experience casts a grim reflection on the theory that the post-war period provided a measure of industrial democracy for Canadian workers.",

I will be considering such questions as: why did people in different classes partake of \"victuals\" and \"spirits?\" How does this reflect their different priorities and social practices at mid century? Emphasis will be placed on public secular feasts -- that is, the banquet, ox roast, institutional repast, and tea and coffee soir\u00e9e -- which were held to commemorate royal and patriotic anniversaries. It is only through these local micro-studies that we can effectively \"get at\" the meanings associated with food and drink.",

General Secretary Oldeubroek's caution was criticized by the Americans, and Charles Millard, Canadian Director of the Steelworkers, was appointed Regional Director, a post established to counterbalance Oldenbroek's influence and to revitalise the organization. However, Millard's zeal was insufficient to compensate for his shortage of international experience, and lack of guile left him vulnerable to opponents among the movement's power brokers. At odds with both the American and British union leaderships, he resigned in 1961, a victim of the constraints placed on labour internationalism by the Cold War.",

This paper examines one aspect of this development, the rise of the labour injunction, through a study of a series of strikes conducted chiefly by metal workers in south central Ontario between 1900 and 1914. In addition to retrieving the largely forgotten genealogy of a body of law that continues to play an important role in regulating and containing trade union activity, the study contributes insights into debates raging among labour historians regarding the role and significance of state institutions and public discourse in determining the trajectory and fate of organized labour.",

Its mission, as stated in its inaugural issue, was as follows: \"Just Labour explores the complex ways new technologies, subcontracting, new management strategies, and emerging self-employment are undermining the traditional employee-employer relationships and disciplining workers. Just Labour investigates how union action has been subverted by the international integration of capital, the proliferation of precarious employment, the challenges of organizing marginalized workers, and the increasingly anti-union practices of employers and the state. Just Labour addresses the culture and activities of Canadian workers and their unions as they face new challenges. The journal will explore new ideas and seek out fresh approaches to solving problems. Just Labour brings the work of leading academics and trade union researchers to a broad readership in popular, accessible language.\"",

        "abstractNote": "Saskatchewan's migrant workers rights regime has been characterized as a \"positive national standard\" for the rest of the country. Introducing the legislation in 2012, then-Minister of the Economy Bill Boyd argued it would \"position Saskatchewan as having the most comprehensive protection for newcomers of any province in Canada.\" In Safe Passage: Migrant Worker Rights in Saskatchewan, Dr. Andrew Stevens reviews the impact of Saskatchewan's Foreign Worker Recruitment and Immigration Services Act (FWRISA) since its implementation. Using cases of employers and recruiters investigated under the FWRISA, this report explores how the government has addressed the exploitation of migrant workers in Saskatchewan.\n\nDr. Stevens argues that the FWRISA deserves recognition as an important piece of legislation that has strengthened migrant worker protections and explicitly recognizes foreign labour\u2019s unique vulnerabilities in the workplace. However, despite the strengths of the legisltion, Dr. Stevens argues that enforcement still remains a problem, with the complaints-based system too often putting the onus on precariously employed workers to self-report violations. Moreover, there is no requirement for employers to demonstrate comprehension of the province\u2019s migrant labour regime in advance of accessing workers from abroad, resulting in employers that are ill-informed or ignorant of their responsibilities. Dr. Stevens concludes that Saskatchewan's existing migrant worker rights regime could be further improved by investing in a more rigorous audit and inspectorate system and through an expansion of community supports for newcomers.",

        "abstractNote": "Enforcing Exclusion\nPrecarious Migrants and the Law in Canada\nBy Sarah Grayce Marsden\nSERIES: Law and Society\nUBC Press\n\nIn Canada\u2019s liberal dream, the law extends its benefits to everyone. But the law also determines who is included in that \u201ceveryone.\u201d Migrant workers, long welcomed in Canada for their labour, are often excluded from both workplace protections and basic social benefits such as health care, income assistance, and education due to their lack of permanent status.\n\nEnforcing Exclusion recasts what migration status means to both the state and to non-citizens. Through interviews with migrants and their advocates, Sarah Marsden shows that migrants face enforcement through law, policy, and practice, affecting their ability to address adverse working conditions and their interactions with institutions such as hospitals, schools, and employment standards boards. Canadian immigration laws create a status hierarchy; those at the bottom experience markedly different access to the protections and benefits of law. This book documents the impact of Canada\u2019s system of migration enforcement on people\u2019s lives and questions the adequacy of human-rights-based responses in addressing its exclusionary effects. -- Publisher's description",

These are agreements between unions and employers that define the conditions under which union organizing will take place at facilities controlled by the employer. The history of neutrality agreements in the U.S. is reviewed, as is the emergence of these agreements in Canada. Neutrality agreements are a model of private ordering that operate without direct guidance from the state, yet their form and application are influenced by state law. The author examines neutrality agreements from the perspective of decentred regulatory theory, in which regulation is used by the state to steer the private creation of norms that are consistent with state policy. Using Ontario's labour laws as an example, the author explores the role of law in the emergence, form, and likely contribution of neutrality agreements to Canadian industrial relations.",

        "abstractNote": "Two conceptions of the right to bargain collectively have influenced its protection in international law. In international labor law, the right historically has been conceived of as one of several workers' rights that protect domestic rights of workers from international competition. In international human rights law, the right is conceived of as a human right that protects a universal feature of what it means to be a human being. This paper examines the status of the right in both fields in light of economic globalization and transnational flexible production. Instead of a weakening of the right at the international level, both fields reveal a trend toward its enhanced protection. Economic globalization and transnational flexible production are also changing the normative relationship between international human rights law and international labor law. They have sparked a third conception of labor rights as international rights - as instruments that possess the potential to vest the international legal order with a measure of normative legitimacy by attending to state and non-state action that international law otherwise authorizes in the name of economic globalization or flexible production. Armed with this new conception, international labor law is realigning its relationship to international human rights law around a shared task of mitigating the distributional consequences of globalization and transnational flexible production - a task in which the right to bargain collectively performs a critical function.",
